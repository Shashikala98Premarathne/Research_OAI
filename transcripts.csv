Threats Relating To Ai And Considerations For The Use Of Ai For Law Enforcement Purposes
2The Afp Protects Australians And Australia’S Interests From A Wide Range Of Harms By Virtue
Of Our Diverse Functions As The Commonwealth’S Policing Agency The Afp Has Responsibility
For Enforcing Commonwealth Criminal Law Contributing To Combating Complex Transnational
Serious And Organised Crime Impacting Australias National Security And Protecting
Commonwealth Interests From Criminal Activity In Australia And Overseas The Afp Also Has
Responsibility For Providing Policing Services To The Australian Capital Territory Act And
Australian External Territories Technology Is An Enabler For The Broader Community Including Criminal Enterprises And In
Turn For Policing The Afp’S Technology Strategy Recognises That All Crime Types And Policing
Functions Are Affected By The Use Of Technology The Emergence Of Increasingly Mature Ai
And Machine Learning Ml Has Accelerated This Impact As It Permeates Many Facets Of
Technology And Society
4 The Afp Recently Published The “Blue Paper To 2030 And Beyond” Detailing The Future Of
Federal Policing This Sets Out Our Strategic Approach To Safeguarding Lives Livelihoods And
Australia’S Way Of Life Well Into The 2030S Within This Strategic Outlook The Blue Paper
Acknowledges The Significance Of Digital Evolution 40 Including The Influential Role Of Ai As A
Major Driver Of Transformative Changes Affecting The Australian Community And In Turn
Policing The Afp Is Committed To Five Future Core Priorities Which Includes Leadership In
Embracing And Leveraging Technology To Meet The Ever Evolving Operational And Threat
Environment Successful Implementation Of New And Emerging Technology Will Play An
Important Role In Shaping The Afp’S Future Operational Effectiveness And Efficiency The Afp Recognises Technology Is Also A Key Enabler For Criminal Activity Against Australians
Including By Cyber Criminals The Online Grooming And Subsequent Abuse Of Children And
Easily Accessible Exposure To Abhorrent And Violent Extremist Material Radicalising Our Most
Vulnerable Including Children The Effect Is Delivered From A Distance And At Speed And
Scale That Is Unprecedented In Our History Ai And Ml Delivers Further Opportunities For
Criminals To Scale Their Activities Yet These Tools Are Equally Essential To Law Enforcement
Responding To This Threat
6 The Afp Is Determined To Understand And Engage With The Threats And Opportunities Posed
By Ai Into The Future The Use Of Ai Will Be Required For The Afp To Effectively Achieve Our
Mission To Uphold Public Safety And Combat Criminal Activities To Do This The Afp Will
Assess The Following Opportunities

507,Safe And Responsible Ai In Australia’,"The Disr Have Called For Public Submissions To Inform Government Policy On The Safe And
Responsible Use Of Ai In Australia The Discussion Paper Highlights That Public Trust In Ai Technology
Is Required To Realise The Economic And Societal Benefits Of Ai It Also Outlines The Government’S
Commendable Intent To Develop A Clear Set Of Regulatory And Governance Mechanisms To Support
And Guide The Trustworthy Use Of Ai To Protect Australians From Harm And Strengthen Public Trust In
The Use Of Ai
This Intent Aligns Directly With The Recommendations Identified In Our Recent Research Report
Examining Public Trust And Attitudes Towards Ai In 17 Countries Including Australia1
 Using Nationally
Representative Samples This Research Shows That Only A Third Of Australians Are Willing To Trust Ai
Systems And Less Than Half Of Australians Perceive The Benefits Of Ai Applications As Outweighing The
Risks The Report More Broadly Highlights That The Public Have High Expectations Of The Governance
Regulation And Management Of Ai
These Findings Underscore The Importance Of Government And Industry Addressing The Significant
Concerns The Australian People Have With The Use Of Ai And The Need To Strengthen The Regulation
And Governance Of Ai To Augment ‘Warranted Trust’ Trust That Is Founded On And Calibrated With The
Responsible And Trustworthy Use Of Ai"

2 Examples Include Using Facial Recognition To Open Your Phone Or Tailoring Of
A News Feed3 However The Datadriven Nature Of Ai Technologies Which Rely On Large Data Sets
That Often Include Personal Information Can Also Amplify Privacy Risks
The Discussion Paper Provides That Australians’ Adoption Of Ai Has Remained Relatively Low With
One Reason Being Low Levels Of Public Trust And Confidence In Ai4 The Oaic Has Also Identified
Significant Community Concern With The Use Of Personal Information In Ai Systems The Oaic’S
2023 Australian Community Attitudes To Privacy Survey Acaps Found That 43 Of Australians
Consider That Ai Using Their Personal Information To Be One Of The Biggest Privacy Risks They Face
Today5
In Addition 54 Of Australians Are Uncomfortable With Government Agencies Using Ai To
Make Decisions About Them Using Their Personal Information And 61 Of Australians Are
Uncomfortable With Private Sector Organisations Using Their Personal Information In This Way6
5 The Discussion Paper Notes That Building Public Trust And Confidence In The Community Involves
Consideration Of Whether Further Regulatory And Governance Responses Are Required To Ensure
Appropriate Safeguards Are In Place We Note That One Of Disr’S Objectives In The Discussion
Paper Is To Understand The Extent To Which Our Existing Regulatory Frameworks And Reform
Processes Already Provide Or May Be Reformed To Provide Safeguards Against The Risks
Presented By Ai We Support This Approach And The Consideration Of How Existing Frameworks
Can Be Strengthened And Enhanced To Provide Adequate Safeguards Before Consideration Is
Given To Create A Separate Regime Specific To Ai 
The Privacy Act Provides A Wellestablished Framework To Minimise The Privacy Risks Associated
With Personal Information Handling And Facilitate Community Trust And Confidence In New Technologies And Data Initiatives The Oaic’S 2023 Acaps Results Show That 69 Of Australians
Consider Compliance With Strict Privacy Rules To Be An Essential Precondition To Organisations
Using Artificial Intelligence To Make A Decision That Could Affect Them7

To Address The Issues And Harms Arising Further Regulation Should Be Multifaceted
It Should Include The Expansion Of Current Legislation And Where Necessary New
Targeted Legislation Not Just A Soft Law Approach Of A Voluntary Code However The
Law Council Considers That The Australian Government Should Not Seek To Explicitly
Regulate Ai Via A Comprehensive ‘Ai Act’

Taskforce To
A Provide Detailed Technical Advice And Guidance
B Consider International Developments
C Provide A Forum For Collaboration Information Sharing And Consultation And

Paper","As Outlined In The Discussion Paper Ai Is Already Delivering Signicant Benets Across The Economy
And Society
We Reviewed The Paper In The Context Of Three Guiding Principles
● Australians Are Known To Be Great Adopters Of Technology And Have Grown To Expect A
Streamlined Digital Experience
● Australians Need To Be Reassured That Ai Technologies And Systems Are Deployed In A Safe And
Responsible Manner And To That End We Hold Ourselves To A High Standard And
● To Enable Individualfocused Regulation That Still Allows Customers To Benet From Emerging
Innovations Any Future Ai Regulatory Framework Must Be Well Integrated With Broader Cyber
And Privacy Regulation
The Best Laid Principles Also Need To Be Capable Of Practical Application For This Reason We
Recommend That The Commonwealth Consider How Beyond Identifying Individual Reform Opportunities
Practical And Effective Ai Governance Can Be Delivered Noting That Multiple State Jurisdictions Have
Commenced Their Own Consultations Into The Current And Future Extent Nature And Impact Of Ai In This
Context We Provide The Following Comments
● Given The Impact Of Ai On All Sectors Of The Australian Economy And Society And Concurrent
Inquiries Into Ai Currently Being Conducted By The Nsw And Sa Parliaments The Federal
Government Should Consider What Institutional Arrangements Will Help Regulators Develop A
Modernised And Consistent Approach To Ai Regulation We Suggest The Federal Government
Lead This Work Through A Newly Established Central Oce Or Advisory On Ai Technologywhilst Protecting The Interests Of Australians Regulation Should Act To Support The Continued
Growth Of A Safe And Responsible Ai Industry In Australia Noting Many Ai Products Developed
Domestically Such As Those Developed By Quantium Have Export Potential
● Ai Does Not Operate In A Void Hence Regulation Should Be Technologyneutral And Take A
Riskbased Approach Which Is Already Seen In Privacy Regulation The Privacy Act 1988 Already
Requires An Organisation To Take ‘Reasonable Steps…To Protect The Personal Information They
Hold…’’ Which Implies A Riskbased Approach To Protect Different Types Of Personal
Information

 And
● Restrictions Should Be Based On High Risk Activities Rather Than Individual Technologies Or
Methods Consistent With Frameworks In Place For The Regulation Of Nonai Technology As
Such App Entities Should Be Required To Conduct Pias For Activities With High Risk"

Focusing Only On The Areas Where There Are Concerns It Will Be Critical To Strike The Right Balance Between
Adopting The Right Guardrails While Encouraging Development Adoption And Use
Australia’S Existing Sets Of Laws And Regulations Apply To Ai Just As They Do In Any Other Circumstance Australia
Has A Mature Legislative And Regulatory Environment That Provides Protections Guardrails And Avenues Of
Recourse
The Problem Is Not That There Are No Laws Governments Businesses And The Community Need A Better
Understanding Of How The Existing Set Of Laws Apply In The Context Of Ai And Its Rapid Evolution Before Adding
New Regulation Or Legislation Government Must Work With Industry And Academic Experts To Identify Where There
Are Material Gaps In Current Approaches
Clarity And Stability Of Regulatory Settings Are A Key Consideration For Businesses Already Businesses Are
Deciding Against Developing Investing In Or Offering New Products And Services In Jurisdictions Where The
Regulatory Environment Is Unclear The Government Must Not Make It Unnecessarily Difficult For Australians To
Access The Services And Information They Want Rely On And Need
The Bca Believes Now Is Not The Time To Deliberately Put Unnecessary Barriers In The Way Of Australia’S Ability To
Seamlessly Become A Top Five Digital Economy Instead Government Needs To Draw On The Deep Wells Of Expertise Businesses And Researchers Have Developed
In Ai To Create Update And Issue Guidance On How Regulators Will Be Approaching Ai In Their Respective Sectors
This Is Why Our Recommendation For Regulators To Work Closely With Experts From Businesses And Academia To
Understand How Ai Is Being Used In Specific Sectors And To Develop Clear Guidance About How Existing Laws
Apply Must Be Taken Forward Urgently
This Holds True Not Only For The Commonwealth State And Territory Governments Also Hold Many Of The Levers And
Have A Pivotal Role To Play Here All Governments Need To Work Together To Ensure A Consistent Regulatory
Environment Across Australia
If The Commonwealths Does Take Forward Any New Regulatory Responses These Must Be Riskbased
Proportionate And Focused On Outcomes Not Solely The Technology Australia Needs Globally Interoperable
Durable And Flexible Regulatory Settings That Set Appropriate Limits While Encouraging Australians To Leverage The
Transformative And Productivityenhancing Benefits Of Ai

Direct Investment Is Going To The United States Than The Us Is Investing Here To Lift Productivity Improve Our Standard Of Living And Grow The Number Of Highpaying Secure Jobs Australia

• Responsible Use Applies To The Creatorsupplier The Value Chain Of Often Global Developers And To The User
• Ai Is A Means Rather Than An End With Uses In All Aspects Of Our Lives And The Likelihood Of Becoming Ubiquitous
In Many Professions Industries And Social Settings The Scale Of The Technology And Global Application Make It
Too Big For The Australian Government To Regulate In Total As With The Internet
This Leads Us To Conclude That Regulation Should Be Focused On A Riskbased Assessment Of The Application And Context
Rather Than The Existence Of Ai Tools In Accord With The European Union And Council Of Europe And The G7 Hiroshima Ai

461,"Submission In Response To The
Safe And Responsible Ai In Australia
Discussion Paper","The Problem With Definitions In The Discussion Paper Is That They Are Used To Delimit The Proposed
Scope Of The Regulation Of Ai As We Argue Below ‘Ai’ As Such Is Not An Adequate Regulatory Target It
Would Be More Beneficial To Identify The Harms We Want To Prevent Now And In The Future And Then
Decide If We Need Ai Or Any Other Technology Social Phenomenonspecific Regulation To Address
These Harms We Expand On This Idea In Our Response To Question 2
Here Let Us Consider The Following Example A Recent Class Action Lawsuit Against A Us Insurer State
Farm Alleges That The Insurer Has Discriminated Against Black Homeowners In How Their Claims Have
Been Considered Resulting In Their Claims Taking Longer To Be Approved Than White Homeowners’
Claims
1 The Insurer Has Used A Thirdparty Fraud Detection Algorithm That Flags Claims Which Need To
Be Investigated Further It Appears That This More Detailed Investigation Has Made Black Homeowners’
Claims Take Much Longer To Be Approved Than Those Of White Applicants The Tools For Predictive
Fraud Modelling The State Farm Insurer Has Been Using Are Provided By Duck Creek Technologies An
Analytics Company Which In Turn Relies On Thirdparty Systems More Specifically The Friss Software
That Delivers Realtime Fraud Assessment On Every Claim Assigning A Risk Score Known In The Industry As The Frissscore This Score Is Based On Both Internal Insurers’ Data As Well As External Data And
Applies Techniques Such As Ai Text Mining For Example To Detect And Make Assessments Of Language
Patterns The Plaintiffs Allege That The System Is Biased Against Black Homeowners If This Is Found To
Be The Case Then Antidiscrimination Laws Will Apply At Its Heart The Issue In This Case Is
Discrimination The Issue Would Be The Same Had The Assessment Been Made By The Insurer’S
Employees Who Discriminated Against Black Insureds Rather Than Discriminatory Decisions Being
Made By An Automated Systemtwo Considerations Logically Follow
1 Why Did The Use Of Ai Models Result In Harm Would Having Aifocused Regulation Have
Prevented Such Discrimination As Allegedly Occurred In This Case Or Any Similar Instances Of
Discrimination Why Antidiscrimination Laws Did Not Sufficiently Address The Problem It
Boils Down To Addressing The Gaps In The Legal And Regulatory Framework Applicable See Our
Response To Q2 Below
2 If Having Aifocused Regulation Would Solve The Problems Identified Then The Following
Questions Arise How Do We Define ‘Ai’ As A Regulatory Target And Would This Definition Be
Suitable In Other Contexts We Believe That It Is Not Ai Itself That Is The Problem Here But
Rather Certain Behaviours Such As In The Example Above State Farm Relying On Thirdparty
Solutions Which Can But Do Not Necessarily Use Ai Without Making Sure They Don’T Lead To
Discriminatory Outcomes
If We Need An ‘Aispecific’ Regulation ‘Ai’ Needs To Be Sufficiently Broadly Defined So As To Include All
The Current Automated Decisionmaking Systems Advanced Analytics Models Models Generating Text
Or Images And Other Systems And Algorithms That May Not Exist Yet Or May Not Yet Be Widely Used
We Therefore Propose To Use A More Neutral Term Of ‘Algorithmic Systems’ As We Do In This
Submission To Refer To A Broad Range Of Computer Systems Used By Private And Public Entities In Their
Operations
The Second Point That Needs To Be Made About Definitions Is That Some Important Concepts Are Not
Defined In The Discussion Paper An Example Is The ‘Social Scoring’ Which The Paper Deems To Be A
‘Highrisk’ Activity First Linking To The Point We Are Making Above However We Define Social Scoring
We Need To Ask Why Only Aibased Social Scoring Needs To Be Banned And Not All The Types Of Social
Scoring Second Certain Common Practices Such As
1 Screening Of Tenants In The Rental Market Which We Discuss In Response To Q20 Or
2 Decisions Made By Banks Or Insurers To Determine Customers’ Eligibility For Their Products That We
Discuss In The Paper Attached
Are In Fact Examples Of Social Scoring Or At Least Are Not Far Removed From The Concept Of Social
Scoring Therefore Any Terms Used Need To Be Carefully Defined Which Can Only Be Done After The
Identification Of Specific Harms That The Australian Government Is Seeking To Prevent"

Give Meaning To Subcategories Of Ai To Ensure Mandatory Regulations Remain Uptodate In The
Fastmoving Field Of Ai Members Conclude That A Clear Focus Should Be On Reaching A Widely
Acceptable Practical Technologyneutral And Futureproof Definition Of Ai

Ai System Is Designed Or Intended To Achieve Rather Than What It Currently Does As The Latter Can
Be Subject To Rapid Change Particularly In The Context Of Machine Learning Generative Ai And

Dr Theresa Kd Anderson Connecɵng Stones Consulɵng
Ruth Marshall Hocone Pty Limited","In This Submission We Wish To Flag Five Key Areas We Believe Need Greater Emphasis As Part Of The
Government’S Consideraɵon Of Regulatory And Governance Frameworks For Responsible Ai
 Misuse
 Data Quality
 Inappropriate Use
 Legiɵmacy
 Trustbuilding Acɵviɵes
The Dynamics Of Ai Innovaɵons Must Be Managed With Full Appreciaɵon Of The Parɵculars Of Australia’S
Sociopoliɵcal Context In Our View This Means Puƫng The Principles Of Safe And Responsible Ai Into
Pracɵce To Miɵgate The Potenɵal Risks From Ai And Adm In The Form Of Evolving Documents And
Processes Ai Developments To Date Have Shown That Many Dynamics And Oōen Unintended Impacts
Will Only Come To Light Through Use We Will Therefore Need Robust Review Procedures In Place That Can
Dynamically Inform Our Regulatory And Governance Frameworks
While Global Focus On The Potenɵal Harms Of Ai Is Driving An Interest And Enthusiasm Of Benevolent
Actors To Ensure They Develop Ai Responsibly It Must Be Acknowledged That Like Spliƫng The Atom Ai
Can Be Used To Harm As Well As Help An Important Aspect Of Safe And Responsible Ai Should Include
Taking Measures To Prevent Powerful Ai Tools From Geƫng Into The Wrong Hands Or Being Adapted To
Unethical Purposes There Is An Argument That The Horse Has Already Bolted On This Front But We
Disagree Though We Can’T Undo The Past Ai Research Will Conɵnue And New Innovaɵons In And
Applicaɵons Of Ai Will Conɵnue To Be Deployed So New Ways Of Prevenɵng It’S Use By Bad Actors Or
Amelioraɵng Its Harm Must Be Developed Alongside
We Also Wish To Emphasise That Building Trust Takes More Than Technology Systems Or Regulatory
Frameworks While Guidance In These Areas Is Important For Demonstraɵng Trustworthiness Building
Public Trust In Relaɵon To The Use Of Emerging Ai Technologies At Its Heart Is About Human Connecɵon
Trust Is A Local And Contextual Judgement That Is Shaped By Personal Experiences Both Posiɵve And
Destrucɵve And Yet Trustbuilding Requires A Collecɵve Effort As No One Sector Or Advocate Can Be Expected To Carry Responsibility Equally Important Is Creaɵng An Ai Ecosystem Building On Australia’S

Furthermore We Emphasize The Need To Examine The Unique Characteristics Of Ai As A
Sociotechnical System The Capability Of Ai As An Actor Cognizant Or Not And The Risk Profile That
Arises Due To These Features Other Examples Of Gaps Include The Lack Of Clear Articulation Of
Responsibilities And The Lack Of Legal Mechanisms For An Affected Individual To Access Information
Regarding An Algorithm When Seeking Redress"
444,Decodedai,"We Are An Ai Audit And Security Company That Has Over A Decade Of Experience In Building Reliable Ai And As Such Have An Internal Riskbased Definition Of It That We Can Share To Help Identify A Future Regulatory Direction And Which We Use To Derisk Ai Systems

By Defining An Ai System Technocentrically As Something Which ‘Generates Predictive Outputs’ For ‘Humandefined Objectives Or Parameters’ The Isobased Proposal

1 Potentially Restricts Alternative Definitions That Lend Themselves Better To Responsible Ai Principles For Example In The Us There Are Legal Arguments Being Made In The Courts That Gpts Are A Queryable Approximatenoisy Compression Of A Large Dataset Rather Than A Predictive System By Taking One Definition The Proposal Preemptively Settles Unsettled Ideas And Makes It More Challenging To Accept An Alternative Construction That May Become Obvious As These Systems Are Integrated Into Our Society
2 There Are Subtle Assertions In The Definition That Are Questionable For Example It Is Not Always The Case That “Generative Ai Models Generate Novel Content” Because They Are Capable Of Leaking Data Or Repeating Content From Their Training Dataset
3 As It Stands The Definition Is Plainly Circular Machine Learning Are The Patterns Derived From Training Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms”

Moreover The Isobased Proposal Does Not Advance Any Of The Other Objectives That We Believe Make A Good Definition Of Ai And Applies Significant Pressure On The Choice Of Words Used Because It Is Technocentric Rather Than Humancentric"
443,Michael Townsend,"The Definitions In Figure 1 Are Not Sufficiently Granular To Support Riskbased Consideration Of Different Kinds Of Ai Including The More Sophisticated And Powerful Ais

In Their Current State These Definitions Do Not Support A Nuanced Policy Conversation That Allows Differentiation Between Ai Models That Provide Economic Benefit Models That Raise Significant Ethical Concerns And Models That Raise Radical Safety Concerns

A Sophisticated Discussion Of Ai Requires An Understanding Of Additional Terms Like How Agentic Or Corrigible A Given Ai Is Adopting Isoiec 22989 1] Definitions Is The Wrong Approach To Framing A Conversation About Policy Law And Governance Because It Doesn’T Open The Door To The Big Questions We Need To Grapple With

The Foreword Itself To Isoiec 22989 Calls Out A Weakness Of The Definition Set For Purposes Like Those Being Pursued In This Paper Specifically The Standard Says It Is Currently Lacking Language For Comparing Ais In Terms Of Properties Like Trustworthiness Robustness Resilience Reliability Accuracy Safety Security And Privacy

These Are The Concepts We Need To Grapple With And Address The Ethical And Safety Questions We Are Facing And Design An Effective Regulatory Regime"

• Human Societal And Environmental Wellbeing Ai Systems Should Benefit Individuals
Society And The Environment
On The Understanding That There Are Sufficient Actsregulations Around This – My Concern Of ‘Which
Individuals’ All Animals Are Equal Only Some Are More Equal Than Others Should Be Addressed
• Humancentred Values Ai Systems Should Respect Human Rights Diversity And The
Autonomy Of Individuals
On The Understanding That This Is For Australia Only – And Therefore Within The Concepts Of Our Culture
Democratic Governing Bodies And Laws As Is Captured Within The Australian Hrc As A Prime Example
• Privacy Protection And Security Ai Systems Should Respect And Uphold Privacy Rights And

Held To The Same Laws As Any Human Accessing The Same Data And The Same Restitution Be Made” Or
Similar Transparency And Explainability There Should Be Transparency And Responsible Disclosure

When An Ai System Is Engaging With Them
This Principle Suggests That The Burden Of Identifying When Interacting With An Ai System Lies With The
Human Rather Than The Ai This Is Not Appropriate Or Sufficient The Burden Must Be On The Ai To
Identify That They Are An Ai To Ensure All Humans Regardless Of Their Capacityculture Etc Are Fully

We Have Set Out In This Document Our Responses To Some Of The Questions Posed By The Discussion
Paper
As An Overview Our Key Comments Are As Follows
 Particularly As We Move Toward Decarbonisation It Is Critically Important For Australia To Strike The
Right Balance Between Managing Risk And Promoting Our Innovation And Productivity Agenda
 Clear And Efficient Regulation In Parallel With Sensible Government Initiatives Eg Regulatory
Sandboxes And Funding Is Required To Facilitate And Encourage Investment
 In Considering The Best Regulatory Approach And Policy Setting It Is Important To Acknowledge That
 Many Of The Harms Or Risks Being Experienced With Ai Today Are The Result Of The Lag
Between The Incredible Speed Of Ai Evolution And The Much Slower Development Of
Organisational Skills Understanding And Capability Surrounding Ai In Other Words Good
Intentioned Organisations Getting It Wrong An Efficient And Immediate Regulatory Response
To This Is Enhanced Guidance Support And Toolkits To Help Organisations To “Do The Right
Thing” And
 Australia’S Existing Multilayer And Technology Neutral Regulatory Framework Provides A Solid
Base From Which To Consider Management Of Potential Harms Across The Whole Ai Lifecycle
But There Are Challenges And There Are Shortcomings Within That Existing Set Of Regulations
Which Need To Be Addressed To Make Sure They Continue To Be Fit For Purpose
Consequently We Agree With The Approach Contemplated By The Discussion Paper That There
Needs To Be A Detailed Review Of Australia’S Existing Regulatory Framework To Identify Where
Regulatory Reform Is Required Given Current And Expected Ai Capabilities"
438,Stephan Jacobs,"Do You Agree With The Definitions In This Discussion Paper If Not What Definitions Do You Prefer And Why

An Effective And Riskbased Approach To Ai Regulation Focused On Ethics And Safety And Ultimately Public Trust Needs To Grapple With A Spectrum Of Ai Capability Such A Wide Range Of Systems Could Fit Within The Presented Definitions That They Are Unhelpful For Informing Policy And Risk Decisions By Analogy When The Government Regulates “Vehicles” It Uses Definitions To Distinguish Pushbikes From Passenger Jets And Then Applies Appropriate Regulations To Each Kind
While Including More Recent Developments Like Multimodal Foundation Modals Mfm Is A Helpful First Step The Paper’S Definitions Need To Capture A Spectrum Of Ai Capability To Allow A Meaningful Conversation The Following 6 Factors Help Define A Spectrum Of Capability
1 Size How Many Parameters
2 Specialised Vs General Capabilities
3 Multimodality The Types Of Data It Can Process
4 Temporal Awareness Is The Model Able To Reason About And Plan For Future Events
5 Active Vs Passive Is The Model Trained To Achieve Realworld Objectives Or Mimic Data
6 Power How Consequential Are The Decisions That Humans Have Trusted The Ai With

Without Understanding A Spectrum Of Capability It’S Impossible To Meaningfully Discuss The Risks Of Various Ais And Any Conversation Will Be Primed For Misunderstanding

To Expand On 6 Each Autonomous System Is Explicitly Given Certain Capabilities Generate Text Decide To Buy Or Sell Stock With Each Additional Capability Comes Certain Risks So The Level Of Consequence For Its Decisions Is An Essential Factor In Discussions About The Safety Of A Given System"

Since The 1950S Organisations Have Been Collecting Data For To Improve Productivity Either Through Better Use Of Internal Resources Or By Providing Products And Services That Improved Their Customers Productivity Until The Late 1990’S Systems Would Have Been Coded From Scratch Using A Structured Topdown Methodology To Ensure That All Requirements Were Incorporated Into The System Design Before Coding Started
Since The 2000’S Organisations Have Been Buying Systems Rather Than Building Them Today Organisation Have Purchase Erp Cots And Gots Systems Based On Functional Perspective And Without Consideration Of Interoperability And Enterprise Data Needs Important Questions Around The Ethical Accuracy Structure And Meaning Of Data Have Been Secondary To It Delivery
The Drive For This Has Been That The Everincreasing Capability Of Technology Alone Would Achieve Better Outcomes Ai Has Become The Latest Of These Capabilities And As The Consultation Paper Says ‘Rich Large And Quality Data Sets Are A Fundamental Input To Ai’ 
The Discussion Around Responsible Ai Seems To Start On The Assumption That Data Scientists Are Dealing With Data That Is Not Fit For Purpose Which Is True Responsible Ai Was Not A Requirement Consider In The Purchase Of Any Legacy System 
Unfortunately Today’S Data Strategies In Government And Commercial Companies In Australia Largely Focus On Implement Functions Defined In The Dama Data Management Body Of Knowledge Dama Dmbok And Not On Use Cases For Data That Will Deliver Strategic Value To The Organisation Maybe This Consultation Might Recommend Responsible Ai Should Be Part Of Every Organisation’S Data Strategy

I Noticed That The Paper Leaves Out Of Scope A Discussion Of Certain Broader Impacts Of Ai
Including On The Labour Market Intellectual Property National Security And The Military I Look
Forward To Further Discussion Of These Urgent And Important Issues In The Near Future
I Remain Deeply Concerned That The Government’S Model Of Specific Risks From Ai Systems Is So
Far Too Narrowly Focused On Too Small A Class Of Risks To Qualify As Truly Responsible I Implore

1 Pathways To Harm That Are Not Currently Prevalent But Are Likely To Become Prevalent
Soon Such As Harms From Interactions With Adversarial Autonomous Ai Agents3
2 Pathways To Harm That Are Currently Considered Uncertain Or Speculative But May Have
Catastrophic Scale Such As Existential Risks From Uncontrollable Ai Systems4 And
3 Pathways To Harm That Are Currently Unknown To Us
These Pathways To Harm Are Less Obvious And Wellunderstood Compared To The Clear And Immediate Risks Identified In The Discussion Paper Experts Do Not Universally Agree On Whether These
Uncertain Harms Will Eventuate5 However This Does Not Mean That They Should Be Dismissed
On The Contrary Dismissing These Risks Because We Don’T Understand Or Agree Upon Them Would
Be Highly Irresponsible Since There Is Some Chance That They Will Arise Rapidly And Unpredictably
And There Is Some Chance That They Will Lead To Devastating Harm When Facing Uncertainty
About Potential Future Harms The Responsible Thing To Do Is To Investigate The Potential Harms

To Take This Opportunity To Lead The World In Acknowledging And Responsibly Navigating The Full
Scale Of Risks From Ai Systems To Do So Requires At Least The Following
1 Funding Interdisciplinary Research Identifying Potential Harms From Future Ai Systems

“To Support Responsible Ai Practices Across
Government Agencies Those Agencies Need To
Know And Recognise That The Decisions They Make

376,Centre For Culture And Technology Ccat,"Our Submission Response To The Safe And Responsible Ai In Australia Discussion Paper Can Be
Summarised Across Five Key Themes
1 Literacy
• A Focus On Ai Literacy And Public Educa5On Can Help Build Greater Trust In Ai
Currently There Is Confusion Over What Ai Can Do And Too Many Assump5Ons
Made About The Poten5Al Of Ai
• A Focus On Digital Literacy Is Therefore Also Important In Helping To Dispel
Much Of The Mys5Que That Currently Surrounds Ai Digital Literacy Can Help Us
Recognise That Many Of The Concerns And Issues Raised In Rela5On To Public
Engagement With Ai Are Not 5Ed To Specific Technologies But Are More Deeply
Embedded In Society And Have Not Been Adequately Managed In The Past
2 Risk
• There Is An Assump5On Within This Discussion Paper That The Risks Related To
Ai Have Already Been Iden5Fied Or Are Foreseeable It Is Important That We
Recognise That It Is Not Possible To Predict All The Future Risks That Are Likely To
Emerge Through The Use Of Ai And Some Degree Of Flexibility Will Need To Be
Embedded Within The Proposed Governance Approach To Account For These
Unforeseen Risks The Proposed Risk Management Approach Is Far Too Broad And In Line With
Other Jurisdic5Ons’ Approaches We Advise That At Least Four Risk Categories
Should Be Implemented Low Medium High And Very High Interoperability
• Given The Range And Variety Of Technologies That Fall Under The Umbrella Term
“Ai” It Is Important To Ensure That Defini5Ons Used In Policy Are Consistent
Across Different Governments Departments And Organisa5Ons
• Australia’S Overall Approach To Ai Governance Should Be Mindful Of What Other
Government Departments Organisa5Ons And Bodies Are Doing Both Within
Australia And Interna5Onally
4 Responsibility
• It Is Important That Australia’S Approach To Governing Ai Protects And Ensures
Culturally Appropriate Development Applica5Ons And Uses Of Ai
• When Considering The Issue Of Responsibility Care Must Be Taken To Ensure
That The Wording Of Policies Do Not Place Responsibility Inherently Or
Inadvertently With The Ai Technologies Instead There Must Be Clear
Recogni5On That Responsibili5Es Are Held By The People Involved In Designing
Deploying Applying And Managing Ai In Par5Cular Where The Ai Is Being
Made Available To Othersopportunity
• Australia’S Approach To Governing Ai Should Indeed Be Cau5Ous Of Not S5Fling
The Opportuni5Es Offered By Ai Auen5On Should Be Focused On Looking At
Opportuni5Es Ai Technologies Can Offer For Social Welfare And The Inclusion
And Beuerment Of Marginalised Groups Alongside How Ai Can Contribute To

This Submission By Contributors From The School Of Computing And Information Systems As Well As The
Centre For Artificial Intelligence And Digital Ethics Caide
The University Of Melbourne Welcomes The Government’S Interest In Regulating For Safe And Responsible
Ai
Ai Offers Considerable Opportunities Across Australian Society But It Is Important This Development Is
Accompanied By Technical Ethical And Legal Best Practice To Ensure That Ai Applications Are Effective Fair
And Safe Overstated Concerns About The Risks Of Ai Obscure Its Real And Present Risks While Undue
Emphasis On The Importance Of Innovation Overlooks The Harms That Ai Enabled Technologies May
Perpetuate
We Consider That There Is No One Approach That Will Ensure Safe And Responsible Ai Rather What Is
Required Is A Mix Or ‘Network’1 Of Regulatory Interventions That Together Promote These Desired
Objectives To This End We Consider That Promoting Safe And Responsible Ai Requires Good Regulatory
Design And The Practical Supports Required To Make Regulation Effective
Good Regulatory Design Means Targeted Responses To Identified Risks Backed Up By ‘Safetynet’ Or
‘Principlesbased’ Protections For Circumstances Where Those More Specific Interventions Prove
Inapplicable Or Ineffective Overly Complex Or Poorly Designed Regulation Is Unlikely To Achieve Its Key Goals
Of Promoting Effective Fair And Safe Ai And Will Merely Increase The Costs Of Compliance For Industry With
Little Real Gain For Individuals And Society
Practical Support For The Regulatory Framework Means Properly Funding Regulators To Ensure The Measures
Decided Upon Are Effectively Implemented And Enforced It Also Requires Training And Education For

How Do We Keep Australia And Australians Safe While Taking Advantage Of Ai Technologies
Source Transitions Shares The Australian Government’S View That Legislating Ai Technologies
Development And Applications Is Warranted Given The Risks They Introduced Into Society
However We Feel That The Discussion Paper Could Be Stronger And Clearly Specify What The Australian
Government Want Ai To Do For Australia And For Australians A Clear Intent About What We Want To
Achieve As A People With These Technologies Will Help Better Define The Legislative Framework To Ensure
We Achieve It It Also Allows Us To Think More Positively About The Technologies And Empowers People To
Think Creatively About Opportunities They Can Create
Our Key Recommendations Can Be Summarised As Follows
• It Is Critical For Australia To Develop Trust And Transparency In Ai Systems So That It Facilitates
The Adoption Of The Technologies And Helps Boost Innovation It Is Also Part Of Developing Ai
Literacy Across Sectors So That Economic And Social Agents Can Take Part And Help Guide How
They Want To Use Ai And For Which Purposes
• Disclosing And Establishing Clear Guidelines On What The Real Cost Of Ai Is In Terms Of
Environmental And Social Indicators And Not Just Costs Will Help Organisations And Individuals
Better Identify Where The Opportunities Really Lie In A Carbon And Resource Constrained World
• A Bigger Story Of How Ai Can Help Australia Transition To Better Social Economic And
Environmental Outcomes Should Be Framed One With A Strong Intent From Government To Direct
Innovation For Purpose Without A Clear Direction About What Ai Should Be Doing For Australia
And Australians Little Of The Potential Opportunities Will Be Achieved
• While Some Aspects Of Ai Legislations Should Be Nonnegotiable Others Require A More Iterative
Approach To Governance Which Will Be Able To Adapt To Fast Changing Technologies And Learning
Outcomes That Can Only Be Derived From “Doing” In An Ai World Adaptive Or Hybrid Governance
Will Likely Be The Best Approach To Learn And Be Flexible In The Face Of Constant Changefinally Providing Infrastructure Such As Sandboxes To Test Regulatory Compliance Of Ai Systems
Will Help Close The Gap Between Industry And Government Knowledge And Make Government
Less Susceptible To Industrycentric Views

Across The Australian Government And Only Seeks To Identify Potential Gaps And Whether Additional Ai
Governance Mechanisms Are Required Page 13 The Paper Itself Notes Many Of These Issues Are Crosscutting And Related To A Broad Range Of Issues Page 4
The Government May Wish To Consider Tasking The Regulatory Reform Division Department Of
Finance Formerly The Deregulation Taskforce Department Of The Prime Minister And Cabinet To
Undertake This Work Given The Division Has Undertaken Similar Reviews Such As Health Practitioner
Regulatory Settings Automatic Mutual Recognition Of Occupation Licences And Excise And Exciseequivalent Goods System
Secondly Rhca Strongly Recommends This Work Aligns With The Australian Government’S Broader
Policy Platform Including The Work Being Undertaken By The Attorneygenerals’ Department The
Digital Transformation Agency The National Science And Technology Council Nstc And The
National Ai Centre Interestingly The Nstc Provided A Rapid Response Information Report On
Generative Ai In March 2023 It Is Strongly Encouraged The Government Establishes Interdepartmental
Committees Idc At Least At The Deputy Secretary Level To Progress And Ensure The Successful
Development Of Ai Policy Thirdly Rhca Recommends The Australian Government Appoint A Particular Department Or Agency
Such As The National Ai Centre To Be Responsible For Australia’S General Ai Policy Given It Has Been
Identified As A Critical Technology In Australia’S Interest Other Departments Could Then Develop Sectorspecific Regulations In Coordination With The Lead Agency As Required It Would Also Be Paramount This
Lead Agency Works With State And Territory Governments Private Notforprofit And Academia To Ensure
A National Consistent Approach Is Developed To Address Ai Fourthly Rhca Recommends The Australian Government Harmonise And Simplify Existing
Legislation And Regulations Commonwealth State Territory To Ensure There Is A Consistent Approach
To Ai Including Related Obligations And Requirements Streamlining And Simplifying Regulation To
Promote Its Effectiveness Should Be A Priority For The Government Rather Than Introducing Additional
Regulations To An Already Complex And Burdensome System For The Private Sector
The Australian Government Should Continue To Engage In International Forums In Consultation With The
Department Of Foreign Affairs And Trade Such As The G7 Oecd United Nations Word Trade
Organisation And World Economic Forum This Engagement Can Support Domestic Responses And
Avoid Duplication Of Work Being Undertaken At A Global Level
Lastly Rhca Can Bring A Global Perspective To This Conversation Given The Ramsay Group Has

How Do We Keep Australia And Australians Safe While Taking Advantage Of Ai Technologies
Source Transitions Shares The Australian Government’S View That Legislating Ai Technologies
Development And Applications Is Warranted Given The Risks They Introduced Into Society
However We Feel That The Discussion Paper Could Be Stronger And Clearly Specify What The Australian
Government Want Ai To Do For Australia And For Australians A Clear Intent About What We Want To
Achieve As A People With These Technologies Will Help Better Define The Legislative Framework To Ensure
We Achieve It It Also Allows Us To Think More Positively About The Technologies And Empowers People To
Think Creatively About Opportunities They Can Create
Our Key Recommendations Can Be Summarised As Follows
• It Is Critical For Australia To Develop Trust And Transparency In Ai Systems So That It Facilitates
The Adoption Of The Technologies And Helps Boost Innovation It Is Also Part Of Developing Ai
Literacy Across Sectors So That Economic And Social Agents Can Take Part And Help Guide How
They Want To Use Ai And For Which Purposes
• Disclosing And Establishing Clear Guidelines On What The Real Cost Of Ai Is In Terms Of
Environmental And Social Indicators And Not Just Costs Will Help Organisations And Individuals
Better Identify Where The Opportunities Really Lie In A Carbon And Resource Constrained World
• A Bigger Story Of How Ai Can Help Australia Transition To Better Social Economic And
Environmental Outcomes Should Be Framed One With A Strong Intent From Government To Direct
Innovation For Purpose Without A Clear Direction About What Ai Should Be Doing For Australia
And Australians Little Of The Potential Opportunities Will Be Achieved While Some Aspects Of Ai Legislations Should Be Nonnegotiable Others Require A More Iterative
Approach To Governance Which Will Be Able To Adapt To Fast Changing Technologies And Learning
Outcomes That Can Only Be Derived From “Doing” In An Ai World Adaptive Or Hybrid Governance
Will Likely Be The Best Approach To Learn And Be Flexible In The Face Of Constant Change
• Finally Providing Infrastructure Such As Sandboxes To Test Regulatory Compliance Of Ai Systems
Will Help Close The Gap Between Industry And Government Knowledge And Make Government
Less Susceptible To Industrycentric Views

As Well As Responses To Select Questions Posed By The Discussion Paper
We Have Also Prepared Three Overarching Recommendations That Consolidate These Responses Into
Practical Policy Or Governance Measures And Are Designed To Complement Many Of The Initiatives
Already Identified Within The Paper These Recommendations Are To
1 Extend The Consumer Data Right To Cover Ai
The Discussion Paper Provides A Comprehensive List Of Principles Standards Codes And Laws That
Might Govern Ai In Australia Also Important Are The Administrative Or Technical Mechanisms
Necessary To Give Effect To These Various Frameworks To Ensure The Barriers To Consumers For
Asserting Their Rights Aren’T So Prohibitive As To Render Them Meaningless Nor So Cumbersome For
Ai Vendors And Buyers To Stifle Their Use In Australia
Australia’S Consumer Data Right Cdr Is A Good Example Of How A Welldesigned Administrative
Mechanism Can Give Effect To Policy Intention In The Digital Era Although The Cdr Was Designed To
Help Consumers Share Data Between Providers In Search Of A ‘Better Offer’ It Could Conceivably Be
Adapted To Facilitate Some Of The Disclosure And Consent Rights Flagged In The Discussion Paper Eg
Requests From Consumers For Details Of When Ai Is Being Applied To Their Data
While The Australian Government Has Paused The Sectorbased Roll Out Of The Cdr Beyond Energy
And Banking A Separate Implementation Track Could Be Developed For Progressing Airelated Data

3 Clearly Delineate Ai From Other Technologies And Approaches But Consider Limiting
The Use Of Aispecific Definitions To Ensure Longevity Of Regulation And A Focus On The
Purpose Ai Rather Than The Technology Itself
4 At This Early Transformational Stage Of Ai Opt For A Voluntary And ‘Lighttouch’
Approach To Ai Regulation To Avoid Stymying Innovation
5 Leverage Existing Technologyneutral Laws And Regulations To The Extent Possible
Where Required Build New Regulation On Working Legal Concepts Perform A Thorough
Gap Analysis To Understand Where If At All New Regulation Would Be Required Align With International Standards And Frameworks To Focus On Appropriately

Safe Use Of Ai","Riskbased Approaches Question 1
Do You Support A Riskbased Approach For Addressing Potential Ai Risks If Not Is There A Better
Approach
As We Navigate The Rapidly Evolving Landscape Of Technology We Must Address The Increasing Role Of
Artificial Intelligence Ai And Generative Ai In Our Society Rather Than Attempting To Regulate The
Intricate Process We Must Adopt A Principled Approach That Focuses On Desired Outcomes That Focus
On Desired Outcomes Ai Including Advanced Models Such As Llm Large Language Model Chat Gpt
And Bard Has Revolutionised How We Interact With Information And Has The Potential To Bring About
Both Positive And Negative Impacts While Existing Laws Often Prioritise The Principle Of Do No Harm It
Is Essential To Acknowledge That Ai Can Extend Beyond The Boundaries Of This Principle Necessitating
The Establishment Of Robust Protections For Individuals And Communities Which Is A Riskbased
Approach Supported By Principles
As The Genesis Of Ai Dates To The Visionary Work Of Alan Turing In The 1930S Its Evolution Has Witnessed
Tremendous Advancements With The Advent Of Powerful Computing Technologies And The Internet
Today Generative Ai Represents The Forefront Of This Progress Pushing The Boundaries Of Innovation
Even Further Recognising That Ai Including Generative Ai Is An Inherent Product Of Technological
Evolution We Must Refrain From Singularly Focusing On Regulating The Process Itself
Instead Our Approach Should Encompass A Set Of Principles And Guidelines That Prioritise Desired
Outcomes While Safeguarding Against Potential Harm This Outcomefocused Strategy Aims To Uphold
Existing Laws That Protect Individuals And Communities Emphasising The Principles Of Do No Harm
We Must Establish And Evolve Laws To Address Emerging Challenges Such As Privacy Breaches
Intellectual Property Theft And Defamation In The Context Of Ai Usageas Generative Ai Continues To Advance And Proliferate The Focus Must Remain On Preventing Harm And
Respecting The Boundaries Of The Law The Fundamental Objectives Should Be To Avoid Breaches Of
Existing Legislation And Ensure That The Principle Of Do No Harm Remains Intact While Acknowledging
That Ai Applications Can Present Novel Challenges
By Adopting This Outcomefocused Approach We Aspire To Balance Embracing The Potential Benefits Of
Generative Ai And Mitigating Its Potential Risks As Technology Evolves So Must Our Regulatory
Framework Adapting To The Changing Landscape And Ai Capabilities Doing So Can Pave The Way For A
Safer More Responsible And Equitable Integration Of Generative Ai In Our Society Fostering Innovation
While Safeguarding The Welfare Of All Individuals And The Community

Addressing The Potential Risks Associated With Artificial Intelligence Ai Systems These
Recommendations Are Based On The Principles Of Compliance With Existing Laws The Do No Harm
Principle And Protecting The Community"

Blunt Instruments Like A Pause On Ai Research And 1 In 5 Think Ai Could Be An Existential Risk To Humanity
3 While Australian Polling Is Limited Data From Kpmg

Topic
5 Csiro Acknowledges The Possibility That Ai Is An Existential Threat And Due
Diligence Is Necessary But Minimises The Concern Because The Threat Is Not
“Imminent”
6

High Level Feedback And Recommendations
The Racgp Is The Voice Of General Practitioners Gps Throughout Australia We Support The Centre Of Australia’S
Health System By Setting The Standards For Education And Practice And Advocating For Better Health And Wellbeing
For All Australians We Cultivate A Strong Profession By Developing Resources And Guidelines To Support Gps
Provide Their Patients With Worldclass Healthcare And Help With The Unique Issues That Affect Their Practices
Our Position Statement On Artificial Intelligence In Primary Care Outlines The Significant Challenges Posed By Use Of
Ai Technologies To The Delivery Of Medicine Our Position Statement On Electronic Clinical Decision Support Also
Includes Recommendations Relevant To Ai
In Short Our View Is That Ai Has The Potential To Revolutionise The Delivery Of Medicine And Regulation Must Keep
Pace With These Technologies To Keep Patients Safe Further Gps Must Be Included And Involved In The
Development And Implementation Of Relevant Ai Technologies As Well As The Regulatory Approaches That Govern
Their Use In Australia
As Gps See More Than Two Million Patients Each Week With Almost Nine In Ten People Consulting A Gp Every Year
Gp Involvement Is Crucial In Ensuring Ai Technologies In Healthcare Are Safe To Use And Fitforpurpose The
Utilisation Of Expertise Of Gps In The Design Testing Implementation Regulation And Postmarket Surveillance Of
Relevant Ai Products Will Give The Best Hope These Technologies Are Appropriate For Use With Patients By Clinicians
In The Australian Primary Care Setting
For This Reason While The Racgp Supports The Riskbased Approach To Governance Outlined In The Discussion
Paper We Suggest That Gps Must Be Involved In Assessing And Quantifying Relevant Risks As Touched Upon In The
Discussion Paper Using Unrepresentative Datasets To Train Ai Systems Can Introduce Bias Into Ai Decisionmaking
A Problem That Can Have Deleterious Consequences In Medicine Including Misdiagnosis And Underdiagnosis And
Can Exacerbate Health Inequality However As Noted The Solution To This Issue Is The Use Of Large Highquality
Datasets For Ai Training And These Can Only Be Built With The Knowledge And Consent Of Patients Who Have A Right
To Privacy And Security Of Their Health Data Which Might Be Both Personal And Sensitive Gps Have Insights Into
These Problems That Would Be Useful To Policymakers Andor Regulators Gp Involvement In Risk Identification Might
Help Prevent The Appearance Of New And Unforeseen Problems Of Safety And Quality That Arise After Implementation Gp Involvement Is Also Likely To Be Key In Building Trust In And Uptake Of Ai Systems Within The
Primary Care Setting
The Racgp Is Supportive Of A Riskbased Approach For Responsible Ai To Be Mandated Through Regulation Which
Should Be Applied To Ai Developers While There Is Potential For Ai To Present Technological Advancements That
Save And Enhance Patients’ Lives The Risks To Patient Safety Inherent To Many Medical Ai Applications And
Potential For Related Liability To The Clinician Are Significant Simply Entrusting Industry To Adhere To A Voluntary
Code Of Ethics Is Not Enough Where There Are Potential Gaps In Existing Legislation Governing Highrisk Ai Use
Moreover Passing The Burden Of Adherence To Ai Regulation To General Practice Would Disadvantage A Sector
Already Under Considerable Time And Financial Pressures
The Racgp Would Support Crossindustry Development Of A Framework For The Use Of Ai In Medical Settings
Where Gps Have A Seat At The Table And Can Bring Their Vast Knowledge To Bear On This Topic We Would Welcome
The Opportunity To Collaborate On Such A Project
In Summary Our Key Recommendations Are
1 A Riskbased Approach For Responsible Ai Be Mandated Through Regulation
2 An Oversight Body Be Established To Develop A Framework And Oversee And Monitor Developments In
Healthcare Ai
3 Gps Must Be Included And Involved In The Development Implementation And Regulation Of Ai

1 Identify The Key Risks Arising From Use And Development Of Ai
2 Determine The Mechanisms Causing Those Risks To Arise
3 Provide Eective Risk Controls Targeting Those Mechanisms
In This Response We Define Two Distinct Categories Of Ai Risk Caused By Dierent Mechanisms
That Are Relevant To The Discussion Paper
• Ai Application Risk Risk Arising From The Use Of Ai In A Particular Application Present
Because Of An Interaction Between Properties Of The Application And Properties Of The
Ai System
• Ai Development Risk Risk Arising From Ai Development Present Before The Ai System
Is Applied To A Particular Domain
We Argue That Targeting These Dierent Mechanisms Requires Three Classes Of Regulation
• Sectorspecific Regulation Such As Professional Standards For Medical Practitioners Or
Requirements For Vehicle Safety Which Helps Control Ai Application Risk General Regulation Such As Privacy Or Antidiscrimination Law Which Also Helps
Control Ai Application Risk As Well As Other Nontechnologyspecific Risks Such As
Copyright Violation But Applies Similar Interventions Across Application Boundaries
• Technologyspecific Regulation Analogous To That Which Governs The Creation Of
Steam Boilers Or Recombinant Dna Products Which We Claim Will Be Required To Help
Control Ai Development Risk
Based On These Observations We Contend
1 The Riskbased Approach Of Preset Risktiering Outlined In The Discussion Paper
Especially For Instance Box 4 Wrongly Tries To Control Application Risks Across A Wide
Range Of Contexts With Technologyspecific Regulation This Approach Fails To Properly
Target Controls Towards The Contextspecific Risks Posed By An Application And Will Lead
To Ineective Management Of Those Risks What Is Needed Instead Is Support For Existing Sectorspecific And General Regulations To Be Clarified Modified Or Enhanced
As Needed To Respond To The Use Of Ai In Their Area Of Concern
2 The New Safety Risks Created By Certain Highly Capable Foundation Models Frontier
Models Are Not Acknowledged These Risks Arise From Ai Development And Are Not
Specific To An Application Sector New Technologyspecific Regulation Of The
Development Of Frontier Models Is Required In Order To Prevent These Risks From Arising
The Following Two Sections Expand On These Points We Believe Regulation Of Ai Application
Risk Is Well Addressed By Other Submissions And Refer The Reader To Those From The Australian
Institute Of Actuaries And The Arc Centre Of Excellence On Automated Decisionmaking

Of Ai Development And Use Which Should Be Reviewed And Updated Before Considering The
Introduction Of A New Ai Specific Laws In Particular More Work Needs To Be Done To Raise
Awareness And Provide Guidance On The Existing Obligations Such As Around Privacy And
Data Protection And How They Apply In The Ai Context
2 The Aicd Recognises The Importance Of Australia Closely Monitoring International Regulatory
Developments Including In Europe The United States The United Kingdom And Canada
Amongst Other Nations Broad Regulatory Alignment With Key Overseas Markets Is Important For
Us To Remain Competitive With International Markets And Facilitate Interoperability With Our
Trading Partners And To Mitigate Any Comparative Regulatory Lag Following A Review Of Our
Existing Framework If Legislative Gaps Necessitate The Adoption Of A New Regulatory Approach
This Should Be Informed By Evidencebased Recommendations
3 The Aicd Recognises Good Ai Governance That Is Robust Yet Flexible To Changing Innovation
Extends Beyond Legislation And Regulatory Frameworks Other Mechanisms Such As Domestic
And Global Standards And Industry Codes With Appropriate Oversight Also Serve An Important
Function In Supplementing Andor Complementing Existing Laws On An Organisationallevel The
Aicd Is Focused On Promoting The Importance Of Responsible And Informed Ai"

Potential To Drastically Alter The World We Live In And Will Impact Every Aspect Of Modern
Society While The Institute Does Not Believe We Should Fear Ai The Australian Government
Should Ensure That There Is An Appropriate Regulatory Environment To Mitigate The Potential
Downsides
Like Many Professions The Architecture Profession Is Starting To Grapple With The Potential
And Real Risks And Rewards Of Using Ai Our Members Have Expressed A Mix Of Concern And
Excitement Involving Ai Both As It Relates To The Profession And In Everyday Life
The Areas That Raise The Most Concern Amongst Members In Relation To The Profession Are
• The Future Role Of The Architect
• Employment Prospects Particularly For Future Generations
• Loss Of Skills And Knowledge Particularly In Future Generations From Overreliance On
Ai To Accomplish Steps In The Architecture Process
• Liability When Ai Gets It Wrong
• Who Owns The Ip From Architectural Drawings Plans And Renders Through The Use Of
Ai
• Unrealistic Expectations Of Clients Who Have Used Ai To Generate “Ideal Home” That Is
Not Functional To Build Andor To Code Benefits Our Members See In Ai For The Profession
• Speed Up Manualintensive Work
• Reduce Time And Costs To Develop Simple Renders For Clients Based On The Client’S
Wishes And For Architects To Ponder Different Design Solutions
• Greater Ability To Show Clients The Impacts Of Changing Design Through Visualisation
Tools Eg Changing The Window Size Or Orientation Of The Home To Maximise Light And
Solar Energy Etc
• Quick Calculation Of Technical Data Such As Energy Efficiency Condensation Light
And How Changing Materials Impacts Such Data
• Identification Of Potential Code Or Design Problems Early In The Process
• Allow For Quicker Approval From Local Governments

Any Ai Regulation Will Require A Wellfunded Regulator To Be Able To
Appropriately Undertake Enforcementwe Consider Voluntary Commitments Pledges And Selfregulation Will
Likely Be Insufficient To Protect Against The Potential Harms Of Ai 1]
• We Believe That Ai Ethics Principles Are Also Insufficient To Protect Against
The Potential Harms Of Ai And That Observations Drawn From Operationallythoughtful And Responsiblyconstructed Experiments In Suitably
Constrained Conditions Are A More Effective Approach To Understanding
And Responding To Realworld Risks
As Noted We Believe That Ai Is Most Effective And Defensible When Employed To

Not What Definitions Do You Prefer And Why
The Use Of Isoeic 229892022 Is A Great Start Particularly In Its Emphasis That Ai Is A Broad
Field Of Which Machine Learning Ml Is Only A Part The Use Of An Internationally Recognized
Definition Also Ensures Broad Compatibility Of Terms
However Care Should Be Taken To Actually Use This Definition Throughout The Discussion Paper
While The Iso Definition Encompasses Ml As Well As A Wide Range Of Other Nonml Based Ai
Techniques A Lot Of The Discussion Paper Uses Ai Synonymously With Ml Which Can Be
Confusing And Perpetuates Misconceptions That The Challenges And Issues Around Ml Exist In All
Of Ai
This Issue Flows Over To The Implied Definitions Of Other Terms For Example Generative Ai Is A
Broad Term That Encompasses The Use Of Ai To Generate Content Of Some Sort Via Both Neural
Networks And Other Means However Much Of The Discussion Paper And Other Documents Are
Written As If The Problems That Exist In Neural Network Based Generative Ai Exist For All Of Generative Ai Such Misconceptions Are Important To Dispel Because Generative Ai Itself Is A
Valuable Capability Regulations That Lump Generative Ai Technologies That Do Not Have The
Problems Of Neural Network Based Generative Ai With The Same Brush Can Only Serve To Reduce
Australian Competitiveness On The World Stage
The Definition For Bias Given In The Discussion Paper Is Also Somewhat Troubling Because The
Paper Ties It To The Notion That Increasing The Comprehensiveness Of A Dataset Reduces Its Bias
There Are Many Applications For Which There Is Simply Not Enough Data To Remove All Bias And
Others Where More Data In Highly Skewed Populations Can Increase Bias By Drowning Out
Poorly Represented Examples Data Is Also Historic It Illustrates Where We Have Been But It
Doesn’T Necessarily Reflect Where We Wish To Go This Is How Training Data Can Perpetuate
Historic Bias
In Our View The Problem With This Definition Of Bias In Part Stems From The Aforementioned
Misconception That Ai Is Ml And Ml Makes Decisions Based On Data In Fact Many Forms Of Ai
And Ml Although Generally Not Neural Network Based Deep Learning At Least Without
Substantial Modifications Can Incorporate Background Information That Is Separate From The
Training Data For Example Background Information Could Be The Assertion That There Should Not
Be A Correlation Between Skin Colour And The Probability That A System Detects That A Person Is
Holding A Weapon This Information Can Be Used To Initialise Constrain And Otherwise Modify The
Way In Which The Ml System Makes Use Of The Data To Manage Bias It Also Allows The System To
Understand Where We Want To Go To Reduce Real Biases In Society Going Forward This
Mechanism In The Definition Of Bias Is Often Forgotten And Deserves To Be Highlighted"

There Seems To Be Some Inconsistency In The Definitional Discussion On Pages 5 And 6 Upfront Ai Is A System That Generates Predictive Outputs Or Decisions For A Given Set Of Humandefined Objectives Or Parameters Without Explicit Programming But At 6 A Broad Definition Of Ai Is Intended That Includes Any Products Or Services Using Ai Techniques… T]Hese Techniques Range From Simple Rulesbased Algorithms Guided By Humandefined Parameters Ie To Machine Learning Neural Net Based Approaches This Seems To Broaden Beyond The Original In That The First Excludes Explicit Programming But The Second Appears To Readmit It At This Stage Of Consultation We Believe Broader Is Better Chasing Semantic Issues Can Lead To Confusion And Under Or Over Inclusion Or Unproductive Boundary Disputes At Too Early A Stage

There Is A Much More Fundamental Issue Here That The Affordances Introduced By Ai Surfaces Technology Per Se Is Not The Issue Technology Is A Tool Rather The More Important Issue Is The Underlying Set Of Policy Positions We Have Adopted In A Range Of Complex Interlocking Areas It Is Important Not To Allow The Debate On Technology And Definitions Obscure This And If Technology Itself Is Not The Issue Then It Is The Wrong Target For Regulatory Reform To Return Briefly To The First Paragraph Definitional Issues Would Be More Significant If Technology Alone Was The Issue 

Consider The Example Of The Failures Connected To The 737Max There May Be Arguments As To Whether That Software Fits Within A Given Definition Of Ai Or Adm But Does That Debate Really Matter In The Context Of Risk And Responsibility And Regulatory Responses Arguably Not Perhaps It Is Splitting Hairs 
Let Us Then Consider ‘Soft’ Automation In The Broad Robodebt Illustrates This It Was Not A Sophisticated ‘Ai’ Based Implementation But In The Public Imagination And Debate It Has Been Cast Within The Broader Schema Of Ai Roboadvice Etc Really It Was A Policy Decision Implemented Through A Simple Algorithm Deployed At Scale And Speed Through Softwarebased Implementation And Developed Protected And Sustained By A Policy Position Failure Of Oversight And Broader Culture That Was Fundamentally Human In Origin And With Dire Human Costs As Well As The Obvious Financial And Reputational Impacts"

201,A Selective Response To “Safe And Responsible Ai In Australia,"At The Beginning Of The “Safe And Responsible Ai In Australia Paper” The Authors In Defining
Australias Ai Ethics Principles Refer To Principle One As “Human Societal And Environmental Wellbeing Ai

When An Ai System Significantly Impacts A Person Community Group Or Environment There Should Be A
Timely Process To Allow People To Challenge The Use Or Outcomes Of The Ai System” Later They Said “The

What Potential Risks From Ai Are Not Covered By Australia’S Existing Regulatory Approaches Do You Have Suggestions For Possible Regulatory Action To Mitigate These Risks

I See Aiml Has Societalchanging Technologies And There Is A Risk That While We Can Attempt To Regulate The Technology In Australia The Nature Of Global Commerce And Communication Will Mean That Foreign Ai System That Do Not Conform To Australian Ethical Principles May Become More Prevalent We May Want To Regulate These Kinds Of Productsservices Or Systems But Visibility Of Issues In Large And Diverse Ai Systems May Be Very Difficult To Uncover

Are There Any Further Nonregulatory Initiatives The Australian Government Could Implement To Support Responsible Ai Practices In Australia Please Describe These And Their Benefits Or Impacts

152,Make A General Comment,"Ai Is A Very Different Proposition For Government Compared To Private Industry
Ai Comes At The Possible End Of A Long Line Of Technology Revolutions Driving Jobs From One To The Next Agriculture To Industry To Service To Knowledge Rough History So In An Economic Model That We Must Participate To Earn To Be Able To Simply Survive We Must Identify Where The Next Jobs Of Comparable Value Are Going To Be Technoagrarian And What Jobs We Are Going To Lose Before Implementing Ai My Children Are Being Taught Its A Net Loss Of Jobs As Ai Comes Into Use So They Are Not That Hopeful For The Future With Ai 8 And 10 Yos
Private Industry Motivated By Profit And Maximising The Distance Between Costs And Revenue Ai Is An Obvious Next Step In Private Industrys Race To The Bottom
However For Government Ai Is A Zero Sum Game What It Gains In Cost Savings It Will Pay For As Welfare Payments As Jobs Are Shed So There Are No Productivity Gains For The Whole Of Australia Which Is The Apss Remit As The Economists Say There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch Particularly When You Are Responsible For The 265 Million Australians Best Interests

• The Government Must Clearly Define Australia’S Risk Appetite Ai Will Never Be Zero Risk If We
Wish To Pioneer Its Development And Crucially Its Deployment As Such Australia Should Define Its
Risk Appetite So That Red Lines With Regards To Ai And Ml Systems And Their Security Safety And
Resilience Are Known
• Endusers And Consumers Should Be Empowered To Make Decisions About The Ai Systems
They Use By Improving Transparency Of Where And How Ai Technologies Are Being Deployed A
Governmentled Consumer Labelling Scheme Backed Up By Independent Thirdparty Product
Validation Would Enable Endusers To More Confidently Use Ai Technologies Knowing Steps Have
Been Taken To Reduce Associated Risks We Have Seen Similar Schemes Deployed For Smart
Devices Which Could Be Built On And Learnt From For Higherrisk Products We Believe That
Continuous Thirdparty Product Assurance Should Be Mandated This Should Take Into Account The
Context In Which Ai Is Deployed As Well As The Underlying Risks In The Technology Itself There
Should Also Be Clear Routes For Redress Where Things Go Wrong Building On Existing Legislation
• Flexibility Agility And Periodic Regulatory And Legislative Reviews Should Be Built In From The
Outset To Keep Pace With Technological And Societal Developments This Could Include
Requirements For Regulators To Engage Regularly With Industry Experts Drawing From A Wide Range
Of Backgrounds And Generational Perspectives • In Assuming A Greater Role In Regulating The Use Of Ai Regulators Should Be Strengthened In
Their Powers Resources And Capabilities
• There Remains A Significant Shortage Of The Skills We Need To Develop Ai Frameworks And Assure
Systems’ Safety Security And Privacy If Australia Wants To Be A Global Leader In Ai The

• If The Government Wants To Ensure That Australian Languages Religious Outlooks Values And

136,"Response To The Consultation
Paper On Ai And Adm Regulation","There Exist Several Potential Risks From Artificial Intelligence Ai That We Believe Australia’S Existing Regulatory
Approaches Do Not Sufficiently Address As Noted In The Discussion Paper One Such Risk Is The Inherent Bias And
Discriminatory Outcomes That Can Occur In Ai Systems Particularly Those Utilising Machine Learning Algorithms These
Risks Can Arise Due To Biased Training Data Or Algorithms That Reinforce Systemic Discrimination To Mitigate These Risks
We Suggest The Implementation Of Legislation That Mandates The Use Of Bias Testing And Mitigation Measures During The
Development And Deployment Of Ai Systems Such A Regulation Would Help Ensure Fairness And Equality In Aidriven
Decisions And Services As A Laboratory Specialising In Biometrics And Ai Testing We Believe It Is Essential That Any
Proposed Measures Or Initiatives Reinforce The Need For Independent Testing And Assurance Of Systems That Include Ai
Or Adm And The Underlying Algorithms
Another Risk Pertains To Privacy And Data Security Especially With Advancements In Ai And Automated Decisionmaking Adm Technologies That Use Large Volumes Of Personal Data The Existing Privacy Act Does Not Fully Consider
These New Dynamics Introduced By Ai We Propose The Establishment Of A New Regulation To Specifically Address Data
Protection In Ai And Adm Technologies Including For Example Provisions For Anonymisation Of Data Used In Ai Training
And Decisionmaking Processes
The Australian Government Can Implement Several Nonregulatory Initiatives To Support Responsible Ai Practices One
Such Initiative Could Be The Promotion Of Educational And Training Programmes Aimed At Creating Awareness Of Ai
Ethics And Responsible Ai Practices The Government Could Also Fund Research Into Mitigating Ai Biases Ensuring
Privacy In Ai Systems And Designing More Transparent Ai Models To Support This We Believe That Testing And Related
Assurance Mechanisms Are A Key Part Of The Future Safe Use Of Ai There Is An Opportunity For Australia To Build
Capability In This Field To Support Responsible Development Of Ai And Its Uses Internationally

No Doubt There Is A Huge Amount Of Uncertainty Regarding The Debate As To Whether Agi Could Pose An Existential Risk Or Not Some People Seem Certain That It Does By Default They May Argue That The Range Of Things That An Agi May Optimise For Is Actually Infinitely Broader And Consequently More Alienseeming Than The Kinds Of Things Humans Want On The Other Hand Others Argue Just As Passionately That Any Ai That Is Intelligent Enough To Have Its Own Goals The Way A Human Would Will Inevitably Sympathise With Humanity And Align Itself With Us

I Am More Convinced By The Pessimistic Argument But I Do Acknowledge The Possibility That The Optimistic Argument Is Correct Of Course No One Knows For Sure Either Way But Given That Uncertainty I Tend To Think That Even If There Is A Very Low Possibility That The Pessimistic Argument Is Correct It Still Tends To Dominate Given How Bad The Outcome Would Be If It Was Correct"

As A Young Person With My Life Ahead Of Me This Is One Of The Issues I Worry Most About And Think Could Significantly Harm My Future While These Concerns Sometimes Seem Abstract Or Farfetched I Think We Can’T Afford To Be Complacent And Must Be Proactive In Heading Off Any Risks Before They Materialise

Typically Highrisk Activities And Technologies Warrant More Stringent Government Oversight This Pattern Is Evident In The Strict Laws Supervising Areas Such As Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Healthcare And Energy In These Fields Both The Technology Itself And Its Applications Are Subject To Regulation From A Human Rights Standpoint There Is An Increased Need For More Detailed Regulation When The Use Of A Particular Technology Has A Higher Potential For Harm To Humans"

96,What Potential Risks From Ai Are Not Covered By Australia’S Existing Regulatory Approaches Do You Have Suggestions For Possible Regulatory Action To Mitigate These Risks,"Ai Poses Existential Risks For Australia And The Rest Of Humanity So I Think Australias Regulatory Approaches Definitely Need To Cover This Risk In Addition To The Other Risks Identified In The Paper Many Ai Experts Including Bill Gates The Ceo Of Openai The Ceo Of Google Deepmind Publicly Signed This Statement Mitigating The Risk Of Extinction From Ai Should Be A Global Priority Alongside Other Societalscale Risks Such As Pandemics And Nuclear War Httpswwwsafeaistatementonairisk So I Think The Australian Government Should Also Make This An Urgent Priority Given The Stakes Involved And The Speed Of Ai Progress

A Regulatory Opportunity To Mitigate Existential Risks Posed By Ai Is Preventing Transfer Of Legal Liability For Airelated Harm To Downstream Entities Just As Manufacturers Of Faulty Airbags Are Held Accountable"

94,Do You Agree With The Definitions In This Discussion Paper If Not What Definitions Do You Prefer And Why,"The Definitions In “Figure 1” Represent A Limited Understanding Of “Intelligence” The Proposed Definition Limits “Intelligence” To The Generation Of Mere “Predictive Outputs” While There Is A Sense In Which Current Llms Are Working To “Predict The Next Word” Or Narrow Ais Are Trying To Do Various Kinds Of Prediction Eg Whether A Scan Shows A Disease Or Which Move In A Game Is Best This Is A Narrow Understanding Of What Current And Future Ai Systems Do A More Futureproof Way To Understand Machine Intelligence Is Through Closer Comparison To Human Intelligence The Definition Should Include The Ability To Understand Plan And Achieve Goals In The World

The Definition Of Ai In “Figure 1” Is Also Wrong To Limit The Scope Of “Intelligence” To “Humandefined Objectives Or Parameters” This Is Wrong For At Least Two Reasons

1 First A Definition That Assumes Ais Pursue Humandefined Objectives Assumes That The Ai Alignment Problem Is Solved Research Into Ai Alignment Is About Trying To Understand How To Steer Ai Systems Towards Humanintended Goals Preferences And Ethical Principles Many Of The Current Problems In Ai Ethics Are Caused By Ais Not Being Aligned With Humanobjectives And As Ai Systems Become Increasingly Capable This Kind Of Misalignment Could Have Catastrophic Consequences Government Should Be Supporting Research Into Solving This Problem Not Proposing Definitions That Assume It Doesn’T Exist

2 Second Limiting The Function Of Ais To Humandefined Objectives Or Parameters Is A Policy Outcome Not A Definition Of Ai Tools Already Exist That Allow Ais To Perform Complex Multistep Procedures And Generate Their Own Recursive Queries Different Ais Can Also Interact With One Another While It Is Likely Wise For Global Governance To Limit The Ability Of Future Systems To Have Certain Agentic Capabilities To Assume That They Don’T Form Part Of Ai Through A Definition Is Misleading"
92,What Potential Risks From Ai Are Not Covered By Australia’S Existing Regulatory Approaches Do You Have Suggestions For Possible Regulatory Action To Mitigate These Risks,"The Paper Does Not Include Risks Around The Misuse Of Capable Ai Systems Nor The Unintended Harms That May Be Produced By Them Especially In Cases Where Ai Systems Have The Capacity To Plan And Act As Agents In Ways That Are Not Aligned With Human Objectives Additionally Existential And Catastrophic Risks Are Not Addressed By The Paper Despite Such Risks Being Acknowledged By Experts And Various Prominent Figures As Important To Address 1 2] There Are Ways For The Australian Government To Take Steps To Reduce These Risks Posed By Ai While Still Ensuring That The Economic Benefits Of Ai Are Maintained

The Government Could Make Sure That Legal Liability For The Harm Of Ai Are Not Shifted ‘Downstream’ By Ai Labs That Create Tools That May Cause Harm Australian Liability Law Is Inconsistent And This May Lead To Situations Where Ai Labs Are Not Held Accountable For The Harms Their Ai Products Cause Because It Is Difficult For Businesses To Understand Or Know What Is Happening ‘Underthehood’ In The Ai Systems They May Be Using A Joint Culpability Scheme Could Be Created In Which Ai Labs Alone Would Be Held Accountable For The Harm Their Products Cause

It Would Also Be Useful To Have A Regulator That Is Able To Analyse And Monitor Ai Systems Using A Developed Assessment Program This May Operate Similarly To The Australian New Car Assessment Program Which Assesses The Safety Features And Technologies Of Cars There Are Also Examples Of Such Things Internationally For Example In The Uk The Tony Blair Institute Has Put Forward An ‘Ai Sentinel’ 3] And Singapore Has Created The Ai Verify Foundation To Focus On Developing Testing Tools And Using Them To Support Responsible Ai 4]"

Description Of A Problem
I Understand That Many Experts On Ai Believe That While Ai Has The Potential To Be Enormously Beneficial To Humanity If Used And Developed Carefully It Also Has The Potential To Cause Enormous And Irreparable Harm If Used And Developed Carelessly Further Many Believe That Current Ai Development Is Not Being Done With Anywhere Close To Sufficient Care And So Expect That In Practice The Results Are Much More Likely To Be Bad Than Good
In Particular We May Be Closer Than Most Would Expect To The Point Where Ai Systems Can Equal Or Exceed Human Problemsolving Capacities With The Difficulty Of Comparing Human And Computer Intelligence And The Rapid Rate At Which Ai Systems Are Improving Some Ai Experts Believe This Point May Be Only Decades Or Even Years Away As We Approach That Point The Risk Of Carelessly Programmed Ai Behaving In An Actively Malicious Manner Becomes Increasingly Urgent In The Worst Case Scenario An Ai Might Operate As An Unusually Skillful Or Even Unprecedentedly Skillful Hostile Actor

We Would Like To Propose The Following Definitions For Consideration
●	Artificial Intelligence “Simulation Of Aspects Or Whole Of Human Intelligence In Machines Particularly Computer Systems” The Definition Of Ai Given In The Paper Is Too Narrow And Is More Appropriate For The Definition Of Machine Learning Which Is A Subset Of Ai Ml Is By Far The Most Popular Subbranch Of Ai Today But Not All Ai Systems Take Ml Approach

●	Machine Learning As Suggested Above The Currently Used Definition Of Ai Should Replace The Definition Of Ml The Definition Provided Captures Some Aspects Of Machine Learning But It Is Not Entirely Comprehensive And Might Be A Bit Confusing Specifically It Focuses Too Much On The Output Of Machine Learning Ie Patterns Rather Than Explaining The Process And Purpose Of Machine Learning As A Field Of Study Heres An Alternative Definition Machine Learning Is A Subset Of Artificial Intelligence That Refers To A Collection Of Techniques Algorithms That Allow Computers To Learn From And Make Decisions Or Predictions Based On Data Without Explicit Programming

●	Multimodal Foundation Model Mfm This Is A Minor Point But The Fact That Mfm Can “Learn From And Understand” Multiple Forms Of Inputs Is More Important To Describe Than The Fact That It Can “Generate” Multiple Forms Of Outputs This Is Important Because Understanding Of Different Forms Of Data Is What Gives Rise To More Powerful Cognitive Traits That Resemble General Intelligence"

•	Page 8 Contains Valuable Discussion On Bias However We Need To Keep In Mind That The Bias Is Often Learned From What Is Inherently A Biased Society One Cannot Simply “Correct The Bias” Instead There Needs To Be A Discussion On What Sort Of Society We Want The Ai Systems To Reflect At Present Elements Of Society Are “Overcorrecting” For Past Biases Through Activities Like Affirmative Action There Is An Implicit Notion That These Are Temporary Measures Until The World Is No Longer Biased But Baking Them Into Ai Systems Can Create Systems That Perpetuate A Different Sort Of Biased World – Not Necessarily Any Worse Or Better Than The Current One Just Differently Biased"

67,Make A General Comment,"I Believe There Are Notable Differences In The Ai Landscape Between Usa And Australia Regarding Monopoly Of Healthcare Data For The Public Good In America Clinicians Had Considerable Sway Over The Decision To Release Patient Data For Research Purposes Including Ai Development In Diagnostic Procedures During This Time There Were Multiple ‘Holdups’ In Advancing Ai Due To Lack Of Appropriate Data Sources The Federal Government Then Passed Laws Making It Illegal To Monopolise Data By An Overseeing Clinician And Additionally Implemented A System Of Hefty Fines For Exhibiting Monopolising Behaviour Since These Laws Have Been Passed I Understand There Have Been No Reported Instances Of Autocratic Ownership Of Patient Data By American Physicians This Type Of Regulation Needs To Be Extended To Australia To Protect The Patient And Democratise The Ownership Of Ai Data
Another Factor In American Ai Guidelines Concerns The Composition Of Datasets Used To Train Ai Models The Fda Guidelines Seem To Be Clear On The Following Points
• Fad Do Not Allow For The Use Of Local Population Data To Reiterate And Fine Tune Ai Models Because This Will Introduce Output Bias The American Ai Model Essentially Becomes A Locked Algorithm There Is No Reinforcement Learning Also The Training Data Set Is Isolated From The Validation Set – This Would Mean Validation Techniques Such As Tenfold Cross Validation Would Not Allow For Fda Approval Of Ai Model Approval
• All Ai Models Used In Medicine Must Be Trained And Validated Using A Minimum Of 50 Usa Population Data
• All Ai Models Used In Diagnostic Medicine Must Be Tested And Certified Against Two Usa Board Certified Radiologists
There May Well Be Many More Pertinent Points Of Comparison Between The Fdaamerica Vs Tgaaustralia But The Above Three Points Deserve Consideration
If Australia Is Going To Advance In Medical Ai Adoption Greater Transparency Should Be Adopted By Tga When Looking At Medical Ai Technology Registered With Tga One Has A Name Date Patent Number And Not Much Else When Looking Through The Fda Equivalent There Is A Much Fuller Description Of The Ai Model To The Point Of Being Able To Read The Code Used In The Model This Is Another Discrepancy Worth A Closer Look
The Australian Government Has A Responsibility To Oversee The Democratisation Of Population Data For The Development Of Australian Ai Medical Industry And Research It Would Be A Very Positive Step To Have An Agreed It Tool Which Would Be Unanimously Used To Deidentify Patient Data Particularly Dicom Images Currently There Is A Very Hotchpotch Approach Towards Cleaning Data For Anonymity The Lack Of Available Medical Data Sets Will Negatively Impact Ai Research In Australia And Limits Ai Research Performed By Healthcare Professionals"

Nov 21 – Dec 22 As A Result Of This Work I Offer Up Five Lessons Learned Regarding Selfdriving
Cars Which Are Also More Broadly Applicable To Ai In Safetycrical Systems
1 Human Errors In Operaon Get Replaced With Human Errors In Coding
The Av Industry Rounely Asserts That The Sooner We Get Rid Of Drivers The Safer We Will
All Be On Roads Since 94 Of Accidents In The Us Are Caused By Human Drivers A Stasc That
Is Taken Out Of Context And Not Accurate 1] Moreover This Claim Ignores What Anyone Who
Has Ever Worked In Soxware Development Knows All Too Well Coding Is Incredibly Errorprone Especially As Systems Grow In Complexity
Several Av Accidents With Coding Errors As Causal Factors Have Resulted In Defect Recalls
Including The Crash Of A Pony Driverless Car In October 2021 Into A Sign A Tusimple Semitractor Trailer Crash In April Of 2022 Into A Highway Jersey Barrier A Cruise Crash Caused By A
Sudden Stop In The Middle Of An Unprotected Lex Turn In June Of 2022 And Another Cruise
Av Colliding Into The Back Of A Bus In March Of 2023 2]
These Problems Illustrate That We Are Only Shixing The Human Error Mode From The Last
Link In The Causal Chain To The First Few Links In The Chain Of Creang Ai This Shix Can Be Much
More Dangerous Since Such Errors Are Latent And Far Harder To Migate Tesng In Simulaon
But Predominantly In The Real World Is The Key To Reducing The Probability That Such Errors
Will Materialize Especially In Safetycrical Systems However Without Government
Regulaon And Clear Industry Standards Ai Companies Will Cut Corners And Focus On Geng
Products To Market Quickly At The Expense Of Reducing Soxware Errors"
60,Ai Poses An Ongoing Risk To Democracy,"The “Manufacture” And Distribution Of False Information And Conspiracy Theories By Individuals Groups And Political Manipulators Is Already A Massive Problem Witness Us Elections The Responses To Covid Etc
When Governments Vested Interests And Wouldbe Dictators That Are Hostile To Democracy Are Already Able Inflict Damage Using People At Keyboards The Prospect Of Credible Looking ”Mass Produced” Individually Tailored Misinformation Is Particularly Frightening

1 Australian Ai Commission
Establish An Australian Ai Commission As An Independent Regulatory Body Comprised Of Representatives From Industry The Australian Public Service Aps Academia Alliances And Civil Society Non Profits The Commission Should Be Responsible For Overseeing And Coordinating Ai Governance Efforts In The Country Its Key Functions Include
 Setting Standards And Guidelines The Commission Should Develop Comprehensive Standards And Guidelines For Ai Development Deployment And Use Covering Areas Such As Data Privacy Bias Mitigation Transparency And Accountability
 
 Certification Program The Commission Should Create A Voluntary Certification Program That Organizations Can Participate In To Demonstrate Their Adherence To The Established Standards And Guidelines This Certification Can Serve As A Market Signal Building Trust With Consumers And Stakeholders"
56,The Difficulty With Regulating Generative Ai,"Much Of The Hype Surrounding Ai At Present Can Be Attributed To The Recent Advances In
Generative Ai Technologies Chatgpt Dalle Etc These Technologies Are Impressive In Their
Way And Are Not Without Their Uses But Their Reliance On Deep Learning Dl Places A Hard Limit
On What They Can Accomplish And Renders Them Difficult If Not Impossible To Effectively Police
The Essence Of The Problem Is That Ai Created Using Dl Methods Has No Potential To Ever
Understand What It Is Producing And Due To The Opacity Of The Model Human Operators Cannot
Make Sense Of Where It Went Wrong To Correct It In Any Way One Of The Main Issues To Address Is That Of The Generation Of Inappropriate Content For
Example A Chatbot Explaining To Inquiring Individuals How To Build A Bomb Or An Image
Generator Creating Deep Fake Imagery Of A Public Figure Behaving Inappropriately If The
Machine Had Anything Approximating Real Understanding It Could Assess The Appropriateness Of
The Input Itself Or If The Model Wasn’T An Opaque Mess Of A Trillion Nodes A Developer Could
Design It Not To Answer Questions Like This But Neither Of These Are Within The Realm Of
Possibility For Any Model Developed Using Dlmethods So How Can The Content Produced By
Such An Ai Be Expected To Stay Within The Bounds Of The Regulations We’Ve Decided Upon
The Current Solution Is To Prepare Moderated Responses To Specific Inputs That It Has
Occurred To The Developers To Flag Which Essentially Amounts To Slapping A Bandaid On The
Problem As Long As This Is The Only Solution Available For Moderating Content Creation
Motivated Users Will Always Find A Way Around It Whether It Be “Jailbreaking” The Technology
Something Chatbot Implementations Are Especially Susceptible To Or Simply Coming Up With A
Way To Frame The Input Without Setting Off Any Flags"

And Responsible Ai In Australia
2 In General We Commend To You The Ethics Centre’S Publication Principles For Good Technology
Which Is Attached To This Submission The Paper Offers Arguments In Support Of A Generic Ethics
Framework That Is Intended To Apply To All Forms Of Technology – Of Which Ai Is One Form
3 That Said A Number Of The Examples Considered In The Text Are Directly Concerned With The
Development And Application Of Ai It Is Worth Noting That The Centre’S Approach Seeks To
Encourage
§ Innovation Giving Rise To A Diverse Range Of Technologies
§ The Incorporation Of Core Values And Principles At The Earliest Point Of Design And
Development
§ The Use Of Technology Such As Blockchain To Track The Ethical Provenance Of All Ai Systems
Tools And Platforms Including The Identification Of Core Values And Principles Embedded In The
Technology Any Changes To The Original Design And Function Of The Technology Etc
§ Ongoing Assurance That The ‘Ethical Restraints’ Embedded In The Technology Have Been
Maintained Or Enhanced – With The Assurance Being Provided By Disinterested Expert Third
Parties
4 Beyond The General Principles Of The Proposed Framework There Is One Specific Suggestion That
We Would Especially Commend It Is That Australia Establish An Agency That Provides In The Case
Of Ai Robotics And Related Technologies The Same Degree Of Protection Afforded By The
Therapeutic Goods Authority Tga For Pharmaceuticals In A Similar Manner We Think It Important
That New Technologies Devices Systems Etc Only Be Released To The Public If They Are Proven To
Be Both Safe And Effective
5 A New Regulatory Authority Could Help To Build Public Trust In New Technologies And Prevent Some
Of The More Dystopian Fictions From Becoming Real Importantly With The Evolution Of Blockchain
Etc We Have The Technical Tools Available To Create A System Of Regulation That Can Also Make
Good Use Of The Assurance Skills To Be Found In The Private Sector As Such There Is An Opportunity
To ‘Shape’ The Environment From The Moment Of Initial Design To Ultimate Deployment In A Way That
Best Serves The Public Interest … Without Limiting The Scope For Innovation
6 This Last Point Is Important While It Is Prudent For Society To Establish Core Principles That Inform
The Development Of Ai And Related Technologies We Should Avoid Ever Specifying The Form In
Which Those Principles Should Be Given Practical Effect Rather Novel Approaches Should Be
Encouraged – With The Onus Being Placed On Developers To Demonstrate How In Each Case The
Core Ethical Requirements Have Been Realised

Biases
4 Accountability And Liability Regulations May Address Issues Of Accountability And Liability When Ai
Systems Cause Harm Or Make Erroneous Decisions This Could Involve Defining Responsibilities For
Developers Operators And Users Of Ai Systems And Establishing Mechanisms For Redress In Case Of
Adverse Outcomes
5 Safety And Security Regulations May Focus On Ensuring The Safety And Security Of Ai Systems
Especially In Critical Domains Such As Healthcare Transportation And Finance They May Require
Robust Testing Certification And Ongoing Monitoring Of Ai Systems To Minimize Risks And

24,Make A General Comment,"1 I Think That Australia Government Will Be To Slow To Act To Allow Australia To Become An Innovation Center
Japan Has Already Secured A Deal With Nvidia To Build A Very Large Ai Data Research Centre The Deal Appears To Give Japan An Exclusive Advantage They Did This By By Removing G Copyright And Privacy Of All Materials Consumed By Ai They Are The First In The World To Do This This Will Mean Ai Model Can Be Build Off Any Information With Having To Get Permission To Use The Information This Will Mean Models Built In Japan Can Be Build Faster By Removing Red Tape Massively
They Also Offered Nvidia This Also Offered Nvidia Large Amounts Of Money To Get The Detail Over The Line I Suspect China Taiwan And South Korea Will Attempt To Do The Same To Compete With Us Current Dominance In Ai Not To Be Out Done By Japan
So If We Want To Compete In This Space In The Same Way Or Be Left Behind We Must Compete The Same Way

14,Make A General Comment,As A Former It Professional I Am Greatly Concerned By The Proliferation Of Ai From The Point Of View That Bad Actors Will Be Free To Impersonate And Manipulate Individuals And Organizations Without There Being Robust Legal Ramifications Lets Just Stop The Roll Out For A Short While Until Appropriate Legislation Can Catch Up
13,I Have A Few Concerns With Ai,"What Is Stopping Me From Typing “Anthony Albanese’S Murder Confession” Into Chatgpt And Falsely Accusing Our Prime Minister Of A Crime He Never Committed Or A Deepfake Video Might Be Generated Of Me Kidnapping Somebody It Might Not Be A Concern Right Now But As The Technology Improves It Might Be A Concern In The Future This Could Have Horrible Implications For Our Justice System And The Integrity Of Our Elections It’S Pretty Terrifying That In The Future If I Ever Have A Grudge Against Someone I Can Get Ai To Create False Evidence Of Said Person Committing A Crime
There Are Three Potential Methods Of Countering This
1	Requiring Chatgpt And Equivalent Apps To Limit What Can Be Typed Into Them
2	Requiring Such Apps To Release Source Code So That We Know Exactly How They Work And Experts Can Better Distinguish Between Fakes And Legitimate Works
3	Create Technology That Can Distinguish Between Fakes And Legitimate Works For Us
Option 1 Sounds Good In Theory But In Practice Somebody Who Is Willing To Falsely Accuse Someone Of A Crime Won’T Be Too Concerned With The Law And Even If They Were There Would Be Methods Of Accessing Overseas Versions Of Said App Or Apps Not Available In Australia Which Could Do The Job Options 2 And 3 Would Therefore Be Much Better Alternatives 
We Should Also Collaborate With Other Countries To Better Implement Options 2 And 3 
We Should Also Require Companies To Release The Source Codes Of Their Ais To Mitigate The Potential Of Deep Learning Causing Unforeseeable Consequences"

10,Supporting Responsible Ai Submission,"The Advent Of Ai Tools Such As Chatgpt Will Be The Start Of A Technology Driven Productivity Increase Of A Degree We Have Not Seen From It Before The Tools Will Affect Every Aspect Of The Economy The Way That Steam Power Affected Every Aspect Of Life During The Industrial Revolution However Unlike The Industrial Revolution The Effects Good And Bad Will Not Take Decades These Tools Are Currently Being Introduced At A Rapid Pace In Business And Have Already Been Used By Many If Not Most Students In High Schools And Universities In This Country Just A Few Months After Chatgpt Went Public

Unlike Other It These Tools Do Not Require Any Training Or Skill To Use Business Will Not Need To Hire People With Specialist Training The Tools Allow People To More Rapidly Complete The Work They Already Do And Take On Tasks Beyond Their Current Level Of Expertise This Will Necessarily Lead To Redundancies And Reduced Employment Opportunities It Is Not Clear That New Forms Of Work Will Become Available To Replace Jobs That Are Lost At A Similar Income Level

There Are Clear Risks In Terms Of Data Security Privacy And In The Potential For Deceptive And Misleading Applications However In My Opinion The Bigger Risk Is That The Benefits Of Ai Will Not Flow To All Even When These Problems Are Dealt With

The Role Of Government Should Be To Ensure That The Hardship And Loss Of Living Standards That Ordinary People Endured During The First Decades Of The Industrial Revolution Where Life Expectancy Fell To Its Lowest Since The 14Th Century When The Plague Swept Across Europe Is Not Repeated Albeit From The Vastly Higher Point We Are At Today To Do This It Will Be Necessary To Ensure That People Have A Much Stronger Social Security Safety Net And That The Companies And Individuals Profiting Directly And Indirectly From Ai Are Taxed In Such A Way That The Money Does Not All Flow Offshore Or To A Small Cohort Of The Wealthiest

It Is Not Hard To Imagine Truly Fantastic Outcomes If Ai Is Managed Well We Could Raise Living Standards Improve Health Education And Leisure And Do So Without Needing To Spend As Much Time As We Currently Do At Work Lets Make Sure We Aim For That Instead Of Allowing Ai To Become Merely Another Tool For The Super Rich To Extract Even More Wealth And Power From The Rest Of The Population"
