Ensure That We Maintain A Competitive Edge In The Global Landscape Australia Must Not Risk
Being Left Behind On Ai
As Part Of Australia’S Drive To Grasp The Significant Opportunities Of Ai The Tech Council
Fully Supports The Government’S Goal To Ensure Ai Development And Deployment Is Safe And
Responsible And We Support The Need For Regulatory Safeguards While Many Common
Applications Of Ai Are Lowrisk There Are Risks And Harms That Can Emerge That Need To Be
Managed
In Considering How To Manage These Risks We Need To Understand That Ai Is The 21St
Century Equivalent Of Manufacturing In The 20Th Century In That It Will Unleash A Widespread
Wave Of Productivity And Economic Enhancements It Will Also Involve A Diverse Set Of
Practices And Technologies That Will Make A Broad Array Of Products That Are Used In A
Broad Array Of Contexts Across Almost Every Business And Consumer Environment
As With Manufactured Products It Is Important To Recognise That Ai Products Will Vary
Considerably Across Different Use Cases A Clear Riskbased And Proportionate Regulatory
And Governance Approach Will Help Us To Capture The Potential While Effectively Managing

Have A Sound Legal Framework And Regulatory Model That Covers The Development And Use

We Reviewed The Paper In The Context Of Three Guiding Principles
● Australians Are Known To Be Great Adopters Of Technology And Have Grown To Expect A
Streamlined Digital Experience
● Australians Need To Be Reassured That Ai Technologies And Systems Are Deployed In A Safe And
Responsible Manner And To That End We Hold Ourselves To A High Standard And
● To Enable Individualfocused Regulation That Still Allows Customers To Benet From Emerging
Innovations Any Future Ai Regulatory Framework Must Be Well Integrated With Broader Cyber
And Privacy Regulation
The Best Laid Principles Also Need To Be Capable Of Practical Application For This Reason We
Recommend That The Commonwealth Consider How Beyond Identifying Individual Reform Opportunities
Practical And Effective Ai Governance Can Be Delivered Noting That Multiple State Jurisdictions Have
Commenced Their Own Consultations Into The Current And Future Extent Nature And Impact Of Ai In This
Context We Provide The Following Comments
● Given The Impact Of Ai On All Sectors Of The Australian Economy And Society And Concurrent
Inquiries Into Ai Currently Being Conducted By The Nsw And Sa Parliaments The Federal
Government Should Consider What Institutional Arrangements Will Help Regulators Develop A
Modernised And Consistent Approach To Ai Regulation We Suggest The Federal Government
Lead This Work Through A Newly Established Central Oce Or Advisory On Ai Technologywhilst Protecting The Interests Of Australians Regulation Should Act To Support The Continued
Growth Of A Safe And Responsible Ai Industry In Australia Noting Many Ai Products Developed
Domestically Such As Those Developed By Quantium Have Export Potential
● Ai Does Not Operate In A Void Hence Regulation Should Be Technologyneutral And Take A
Riskbased Approach Which Is Already Seen In Privacy Regulation The Privacy Act 1988 Already
Requires An Organisation To Take ‘Reasonable Steps…To Protect The Personal Information They
Hold…’’ Which Implies A Riskbased Approach To Protect Different Types Of Personal
Information

Incredible Things Create A New Era Of Economic And Social Opportunities And Give
Individuals Creators And Businesses New Ways To Express Themselves And Connect With

Before Discussing Governance Options In Relation To Ai To Assist The Department With Its
Consultation We Wanted To First Share Some Background About How Meta Uses Ai And Our
Approach Focused On Transparency Openness And Responsible Innovation At Meta We Believe Ai Should Benefit Everyone – Not Just A Handful Of Companies Ai
Innovation Is Inevitable And Ai Should Be Built To Benefit The Whole Of Society Like All
Foundational Technologies – From Radio Transmitters To Internet Operating Systems – There
Will Be A Multitude Of Uses For Ai Models Some Predictable And Some Not And Like Every
Technology Ai Will Be Used For Both Good And Misused By Good And Bad People While We
Can’T Eliminate The Risks We Can Mitigate Them
As Part Of Considering How To Mitigate Risks From Ai It Is Also Important To Recognise The
Extent To Which Ai Is Already Widely Deployed Within Industry Especially As Part Of Any
Discussions About What If Any New Regulatory Frameworks May Be Needed A Review Of
The Existing Uses Of Ai By The Industry Will Assist In Identifying The Role Of Ai To Comply

461,"Submission In Response To The
Safe And Responsible Ai In Australia
Discussion Paper","The Problem With Definitions In The Discussion Paper Is That They Are Used To Delimit The Proposed
Scope Of The Regulation Of Ai As We Argue Below ‘Ai’ As Such Is Not An Adequate Regulatory Target It
Would Be More Beneficial To Identify The Harms We Want To Prevent Now And In The Future And Then
Decide If We Need Ai Or Any Other Technology Social Phenomenonspecific Regulation To Address
These Harms We Expand On This Idea In Our Response To Question 2
Here Let Us Consider The Following Example A Recent Class Action Lawsuit Against A Us Insurer State
Farm Alleges That The Insurer Has Discriminated Against Black Homeowners In How Their Claims Have
Been Considered Resulting In Their Claims Taking Longer To Be Approved Than White Homeowners’
Claims
1 The Insurer Has Used A Thirdparty Fraud Detection Algorithm That Flags Claims Which Need To
Be Investigated Further It Appears That This More Detailed Investigation Has Made Black Homeowners’
Claims Take Much Longer To Be Approved Than Those Of White Applicants The Tools For Predictive
Fraud Modelling The State Farm Insurer Has Been Using Are Provided By Duck Creek Technologies An
Analytics Company Which In Turn Relies On Thirdparty Systems More Specifically The Friss Software
That Delivers Realtime Fraud Assessment On Every Claim Assigning A Risk Score Known In The Industry As The Frissscore This Score Is Based On Both Internal Insurers’ Data As Well As External Data And
Applies Techniques Such As Ai Text Mining For Example To Detect And Make Assessments Of Language
Patterns The Plaintiffs Allege That The System Is Biased Against Black Homeowners If This Is Found To
Be The Case Then Antidiscrimination Laws Will Apply At Its Heart The Issue In This Case Is
Discrimination The Issue Would Be The Same Had The Assessment Been Made By The Insurer’S
Employees Who Discriminated Against Black Insureds Rather Than Discriminatory Decisions Being
Made By An Automated Systemtwo Considerations Logically Follow
1 Why Did The Use Of Ai Models Result In Harm Would Having Aifocused Regulation Have
Prevented Such Discrimination As Allegedly Occurred In This Case Or Any Similar Instances Of
Discrimination Why Antidiscrimination Laws Did Not Sufficiently Address The Problem It
Boils Down To Addressing The Gaps In The Legal And Regulatory Framework Applicable See Our
Response To Q2 Below
2 If Having Aifocused Regulation Would Solve The Problems Identified Then The Following
Questions Arise How Do We Define ‘Ai’ As A Regulatory Target And Would This Definition Be
Suitable In Other Contexts We Believe That It Is Not Ai Itself That Is The Problem Here But
Rather Certain Behaviours Such As In The Example Above State Farm Relying On Thirdparty
Solutions Which Can But Do Not Necessarily Use Ai Without Making Sure They Don’T Lead To
Discriminatory Outcomes
If We Need An ‘Aispecific’ Regulation ‘Ai’ Needs To Be Sufficiently Broadly Defined So As To Include All
The Current Automated Decisionmaking Systems Advanced Analytics Models Models Generating Text
Or Images And Other Systems And Algorithms That May Not Exist Yet Or May Not Yet Be Widely Used
We Therefore Propose To Use A More Neutral Term Of ‘Algorithmic Systems’ As We Do In This
Submission To Refer To A Broad Range Of Computer Systems Used By Private And Public Entities In Their
Operations
The Second Point That Needs To Be Made About Definitions Is That Some Important Concepts Are Not
Defined In The Discussion Paper An Example Is The ‘Social Scoring’ Which The Paper Deems To Be A
‘Highrisk’ Activity First Linking To The Point We Are Making Above However We Define Social Scoring
We Need To Ask Why Only Aibased Social Scoring Needs To Be Banned And Not All The Types Of Social
Scoring Second Certain Common Practices Such As
1 Screening Of Tenants In The Rental Market Which We Discuss In Response To Q20 Or
2 Decisions Made By Banks Or Insurers To Determine Customers’ Eligibility For Their Products That We
Discuss In The Paper Attached
Are In Fact Examples Of Social Scoring Or At Least Are Not Far Removed From The Concept Of Social

2 There Are Subtle Assertions In The Definition That Are Questionable For Example It Is Not Always The Case That “Generative Ai Models Generate Novel Content” Because They Are Capable Of Leaking Data Or Repeating Content From Their Training Dataset
3 As It Stands The Definition Is Plainly Circular Machine Learning Are The Patterns Derived From Training Data Using Machine Learning Algorithms”

415,Data As Foundation For Responsible Ai,"In Listening To The Safe And Responsible Ai Virtual Town Hall I Was Perplexed That There Was Little Mention Of The Role Data Management Plays As A Foundation For Responsible Ai 
Since The 1950S Organisations Have Been Collecting Data For To Improve Productivity Either Through Better Use Of Internal Resources Or By Providing Products And Services That Improved Their Customers Productivity Until The Late 1990’S Systems Would Have Been Coded From Scratch Using A Structured Topdown Methodology To Ensure That All Requirements Were Incorporated Into The System Design Before Coding Started
Since The 2000’S Organisations Have Been Buying Systems Rather Than Building Them Today Organisation Have Purchase Erp Cots And Gots Systems Based On Functional Perspective And Without Consideration Of Interoperability And Enterprise Data Needs Important Questions Around The Ethical Accuracy Structure And Meaning Of Data Have Been Secondary To It Delivery
The Drive For This Has Been That The Everincreasing Capability Of Technology Alone Would Achieve Better Outcomes Ai Has Become The Latest Of These Capabilities And As The Consultation Paper Says ‘Rich Large And Quality Data Sets Are A Fundamental Input To Ai’ 
The Discussion Around Responsible Ai Seems To Start On The Assumption That Data Scientists Are Dealing With Data That Is Not Fit For Purpose Which Is True Responsible Ai Was Not A Requirement Consider In The Purchase Of Any Legacy System 
Unfortunately Today’S Data Strategies In Government And Commercial Companies In Australia Largely Focus On Implement Functions Defined In The Dama Data Management Body Of Knowledge Dama Dmbok And Not On Use Cases For Data That Will Deliver Strategic Value To The Organisation Maybe This Consultation Might Recommend Responsible Ai Should Be Part Of Every Organisation’S Data Strategy
However There Is One Function Of Data Management Which I Think Is Worth Making A Submission Regarding Responsible Ai That Is Reference Data Management Rdm Which Is Concern With Managing Data That Categorises Other Data In A Dataset",343,321,['in listening to the safe and responsible ai virtual town hall i was per ##plex ##ed that there was little mention of the role data management plays as a foundation for responsible ai since the s organisations have been collecting data for to improve productivity either through better use of internal resources or by providing products and services that improved their customers productivity until the late s systems would have been coded from scratch using a structured top ##down methodology to ensure that all requirements were incorporated into the system design before coding started since the s organisations have been buying systems rather than building them today organisation have purchase er ##p cot ##s and got ##s systems based on functional perspective and without consideration of inter ##oper ##ability and enterprise data needs important questions around the ethical accuracy structure and meaning of data have been secondary to it delivery the drive for this has been that the ever ##in ##cre ##asi ##ng capability of technology alone would achieve better outcomes ai has become the latest of these capabilities and as the consultation paper says rich large and quality data sets are a fundamental input to ai the discussion around responsible ai seems to start on the assumption that data scientists are dealing with data that is not fit for purpose which is true responsible ai was not a requirement consider in the purchase of any legacy system unfortunately today ##s data strategies in government and commercial companies in australia largely focus on implement functions defined in the dam ##a data management body of knowledge dam ##a d ##mbo ##k and not on use cases for data that will deliver strategic value to the organisation maybe this consultation might recommend responsible ai should be part of every organisations data strategy however there is one function of data management which i think is worth making a submission regarding responsible ai that is reference data management rd ##m which is concern with managing data that cat ##ego ##rise ##s other data in a data ##set']

Summarised Across Five Key Themes
1 Literacy
• A Focus On Ai Literacy And Public Educa5On Can Help Build Greater Trust In Ai
Currently There Is Confusion Over What Ai Can Do And Too Many Assump5Ons
Made About The Poten5Al Of Ai
• A Focus On Digital Literacy Is Therefore Also Important In Helping To Dispel
Much Of The Mys5Que That Currently Surrounds Ai Digital Literacy Can Help Us
Recognise That Many Of The Concerns And Issues Raised In Rela5On To Public
Engagement With Ai Are Not 5Ed To Specific Technologies But Are More Deeply
Embedded In Society And Have Not Been Adequately Managed In The Past
2 Risk
• There Is An Assump5On Within This Discussion Paper That The Risks Related To
Ai Have Already Been Iden5Fied Or Are Foreseeable It Is Important That We
Recognise That It Is Not Possible To Predict All The Future Risks That Are Likely To
Emerge Through The Use Of Ai And Some Degree Of Flexibility Will Need To Be
Embedded Within The Proposed Governance Approach To Account For These
Unforeseen Risks The Proposed Risk Management Approach Is Far Too Broad And In Line With
Other Jurisdic5Ons’ Approaches We Advise That At Least Four Risk Categories
Should Be Implemented Low Medium High And Very High Interoperability
• Given The Range And Variety Of Technologies That Fall Under The Umbrella Term
“Ai” It Is Important To Ensure That Defini5Ons Used In Policy Are Consistent
Across Different Governments Departments And Organisa5Ons
• Australia’S Overall Approach To Ai Governance Should Be Mindful Of What Other
Government Departments Organisa5Ons And Bodies Are Doing Both Within
Australia And Interna5Onally
4 Responsibility
• It Is Important That Australia’S Approach To Governing Ai Protects And Ensures
Culturally Appropriate Development Applica5Ons And Uses Of Ai
• When Considering The Issue Of Responsibility Care Must Be Taken To Ensure
That The Wording Of Policies Do Not Place Responsibility Inherently Or
Inadvertently With The Ai Technologies Instead There Must Be Clear
Recogni5On That Responsibili5Es Are Held By The People Involved In Designing
Deploying Applying And Managing Ai In Par5Cular Where The Ai Is Being
Made Available To Othersopportunity
• Australia’S Approach To Governing Ai Should Indeed Be Cau5Ous Of Not S5Fling

Achieve As A People With These Technologies Will Help Better Define The Legislative Framework To Ensure
We Achieve It It Also Allows Us To Think More Positively About The Technologies And Empowers People To
Think Creatively About Opportunities They Can Create
Our Key Recommendations Can Be Summarised As Follows
• It Is Critical For Australia To Develop Trust And Transparency In Ai Systems So That It Facilitates
The Adoption Of The Technologies And Helps Boost Innovation It Is Also Part Of Developing Ai
Literacy Across Sectors So That Economic And Social Agents Can Take Part And Help Guide How
They Want To Use Ai And For Which Purposes
• Disclosing And Establishing Clear Guidelines On What The Real Cost Of Ai Is In Terms Of
Environmental And Social Indicators And Not Just Costs Will Help Organisations And Individuals
Better Identify Where The Opportunities Really Lie In A Carbon And Resource Constrained World
• A Bigger Story Of How Ai Can Help Australia Transition To Better Social Economic And
Environmental Outcomes Should Be Framed One With A Strong Intent From Government To Direct
Innovation For Purpose Without A Clear Direction About What Ai Should Be Doing For Australia
And Australians Little Of The Potential Opportunities Will Be Achieved
• While Some Aspects Of Ai Legislations Should Be Nonnegotiable Others Require A More Iterative
Approach To Governance Which Will Be Able To Adapt To Fast Changing Technologies And Learning
Outcomes That Can Only Be Derived From “Doing” In An Ai World Adaptive Or Hybrid Governance
Will Likely Be The Best Approach To Learn And Be Flexible In The Face Of Constant Changefinally Providing Infrastructure Such As Sandboxes To Test Regulatory Compliance Of Ai Systems

2 What Potential Risks From Ai Are Not Covered By Australia’S Existing Regulatory Approaches
Do You Have Suggestions For Possible Regulatory Action To Mitigate These Risks
17 What Elements Should Be In A Riskbased Approach For Addressing Potential Ai Risks Do
You Support The Elements Presented In Attachment C
20 Should A Riskbased Approach For Responsible Ai Be A Voluntary Or Selfregulation Tool Or
Be Mandated Through Regulation And Should It Apply To A Public Or Private Organisations Or
Both B Developers Or Deployers Or Both
Unintended Behaviours Or Outcomes From Ai Pose A General Yet Significant Risk Due To The
Complexity Of Certain Ai Algorithms And Their Interaction With An Ai Environment These
Unintended Behaviour Or Outcomes Can Range From Minor Errors Or Inaccuracies To Potentially
Harmful Consequences That Impact The Safety1 And Wellbeing Of Society2
 For Example The
Increasing Number Of Reported Ai Incidents Has Shown A Trend Of Generative Ai Tools Being
Used To Create Misinformation3 That Is Accessible To The World Misinformation Existed Before
Generative Ai Was Available At Scale The Rapid Uptake Of Generative Ai Has Amplified The
Likelihood Of Public Manipulation Through Misinformation With The Potential To Impact Society
And Global Security At Large This Is A Current Example And As We Are Still In The Early Stages Of Ai Development And
Deployment We Are Already Witnessing The Widespread Impact Of Misinformation Capturing
Public Attention Through Social Media Platforms Imagine The Possible Unintended Outcomes If
We Dont Have Checks In Place To Manage This Risk In The Future
Acknowledging The Unintended Behaviours Or Outcomes From Ai Relating But Not Limited To
• The Use Of Personal Identifiable Information Which Could Be Mitigated Through
Strategies To Create Greater Transparency As Indicated By The Result From A Recent
Privacy Act Review Report
• Creating Bias And Discrimination In Autodecision Making Which Could Be Mitigated
Via Existing Australia’S Antidiscrimination Laws
• Online Safety Concerns Which Are Being Addressed Through The Work Of Esafety

Department Of Industry Science And Resources
Discussion Paper","We Understand That The Fundamental Underlying Question Being Asked Is
How Do We Keep Australia And Australians Safe While Taking Advantage Of Ai Technologies
Source Transitions Shares The Australian Government’S View That Legislating Ai Technologies
Development And Applications Is Warranted Given The Risks They Introduced Into Society
However We Feel That The Discussion Paper Could Be Stronger And Clearly Specify What The Australian
Government Want Ai To Do For Australia And For Australians A Clear Intent About What We Want To
Achieve As A People With These Technologies Will Help Better Define The Legislative Framework To Ensure
We Achieve It It Also Allows Us To Think More Positively About The Technologies And Empowers People To
Think Creatively About Opportunities They Can Create
Our Key Recommendations Can Be Summarised As Follows
• It Is Critical For Australia To Develop Trust And Transparency In Ai Systems So That It Facilitates
The Adoption Of The Technologies And Helps Boost Innovation It Is Also Part Of Developing Ai
Literacy Across Sectors So That Economic And Social Agents Can Take Part And Help Guide How
They Want To Use Ai And For Which Purposes
• Disclosing And Establishing Clear Guidelines On What The Real Cost Of Ai Is In Terms Of
Environmental And Social Indicators And Not Just Costs Will Help Organisations And Individuals
Better Identify Where The Opportunities Really Lie In A Carbon And Resource Constrained World
• A Bigger Story Of How Ai Can Help Australia Transition To Better Social Economic And
Environmental Outcomes Should Be Framed One With A Strong Intent From Government To Direct
Innovation For Purpose Without A Clear Direction About What Ai Should Be Doing For Australia
And Australians Little Of The Potential Opportunities Will Be Achieved While Some Aspects Of Ai Legislations Should Be Nonnegotiable Others Require A More Iterative
Approach To Governance Which Will Be Able To Adapt To Fast Changing Technologies And Learning
Outcomes That Can Only Be Derived From “Doing” In An Ai World Adaptive Or Hybrid Governance
Will Likely Be The Best Approach To Learn And Be Flexible In The Face Of Constant Change
• Finally Providing Infrastructure Such As Sandboxes To Test Regulatory Compliance Of Ai Systems
Will Help Close The Gap Between Industry And Government Knowledge And Make Government
Less Susceptible To Industrycentric Views
Source Transitions Already Works With Businesses And The Notforprofit Sector To Help Them Develop
Pathways To Sustainable Futures Using Ai And An Enabler As A Result Of These Initiatives Ai Literacy

Do You Support A Riskbased Approach For Addressing Potential Ai Risks If Not Is There A Better
Approach
As We Navigate The Rapidly Evolving Landscape Of Technology We Must Address The Increasing Role Of
Artificial Intelligence Ai And Generative Ai In Our Society Rather Than Attempting To Regulate The
Intricate Process We Must Adopt A Principled Approach That Focuses On Desired Outcomes That Focus
On Desired Outcomes Ai Including Advanced Models Such As Llm Large Language Model Chat Gpt

Both Positive And Negative Impacts While Existing Laws Often Prioritise The Principle Of Do No Harm It
Is Essential To Acknowledge That Ai Can Extend Beyond The Boundaries Of This Principle Necessitating
The Establishment Of Robust Protections For Individuals And Communities Which Is A Riskbased
Approach Supported By Principles
As The Genesis Of Ai Dates To The Visionary Work Of Alan Turing In The 1930S Its Evolution Has Witnessed
Tremendous Advancements With The Advent Of Powerful Computing Technologies And The Internet
Today Generative Ai Represents The Forefront Of This Progress Pushing The Boundaries Of Innovation
Even Further Recognising That Ai Including Generative Ai Is An Inherent Product Of Technological
Evolution We Must Refrain From Singularly Focusing On Regulating The Process Itself
Instead Our Approach Should Encompass A Set Of Principles And Guidelines That Prioritise Desired
Outcomes While Safeguarding Against Potential Harm This Outcomefocused Strategy Aims To Uphold
Existing Laws That Protect Individuals And Communities Emphasising The Principles Of Do No Harm
We Must Establish And Evolve Laws To Address Emerging Challenges Such As Privacy Breaches
Intellectual Property Theft And Defamation In The Context Of Ai Usageas Generative Ai Continues To Advance And Proliferate The Focus Must Remain On Preventing Harm And
Respecting The Boundaries Of The Law The Fundamental Objectives Should Be To Avoid Breaches Of
Existing Legislation And Ensure That The Principle Of Do No Harm Remains Intact While Acknowledging
That Ai Applications Can Present Novel Challenges

Response To The Department’S Discussion Paper ‘Safe And Responsible Ai In Australia’ Rather Than Addressing The
Specific Questions In The Consultation Paper Many Of Which Are Outside Of The Remit Of The Racgp We Provide
High Level Feedback And Recommendations
The Racgp Is The Voice Of General Practitioners Gps Throughout Australia We Support The Centre Of Australia’S
Health System By Setting The Standards For Education And Practice And Advocating For Better Health And Wellbeing
For All Australians We Cultivate A Strong Profession By Developing Resources And Guidelines To Support Gps
Provide Their Patients With Worldclass Healthcare And Help With The Unique Issues That Affect Their Practices
Our Position Statement On Artificial Intelligence In Primary Care Outlines The Significant Challenges Posed By Use Of
Ai Technologies To The Delivery Of Medicine Our Position Statement On Electronic Clinical Decision Support Also
Includes Recommendations Relevant To Ai
In Short Our View Is That Ai Has The Potential To Revolutionise The Delivery Of Medicine And Regulation Must Keep
Pace With These Technologies To Keep Patients Safe Further Gps Must Be Included And Involved In The
Development And Implementation Of Relevant Ai Technologies As Well As The Regulatory Approaches That Govern
Their Use In Australia
As Gps See More Than Two Million Patients Each Week With Almost Nine In Ten People Consulting A Gp Every Year
Gp Involvement Is Crucial In Ensuring Ai Technologies In Healthcare Are Safe To Use And Fitforpurpose The
Utilisation Of Expertise Of Gps In The Design Testing Implementation Regulation And Postmarket Surveillance Of
Relevant Ai Products Will Give The Best Hope These Technologies Are Appropriate For Use With Patients By Clinicians
In The Australian Primary Care Setting
For This Reason While The Racgp Supports The Riskbased Approach To Governance Outlined In The Discussion
Paper We Suggest That Gps Must Be Involved In Assessing And Quantifying Relevant Risks As Touched Upon In The
Discussion Paper Using Unrepresentative Datasets To Train Ai Systems Can Introduce Bias Into Ai Decisionmaking
A Problem That Can Have Deleterious Consequences In Medicine Including Misdiagnosis And Underdiagnosis And
Can Exacerbate Health Inequality However As Noted The Solution To This Issue Is The Use Of Large Highquality
Datasets For Ai Training And These Can Only Be Built With The Knowledge And Consent Of Patients Who Have A Right
To Privacy And Security Of Their Health Data Which Might Be Both Personal And Sensitive Gps Have Insights Into
These Problems That Would Be Useful To Policymakers Andor Regulators Gp Involvement In Risk Identification Might
Help Prevent The Appearance Of New And Unforeseen Problems Of Safety And Quality That Arise After Implementation Gp Involvement Is Also Likely To Be Key In Building Trust In And Uptake Of Ai Systems Within The
Primary Care Setting
The Racgp Is Supportive Of A Riskbased Approach For Responsible Ai To Be Mandated Through Regulation Which
Should Be Applied To Ai Developers While There Is Potential For Ai To Present Technological Advancements That
Save And Enhance Patients’ Lives The Risks To Patient Safety Inherent To Many Medical Ai Applications And
Potential For Related Liability To The Clinician Are Significant Simply Entrusting Industry To Adhere To A Voluntary
Code Of Ethics Is Not Enough Where There Are Potential Gaps In Existing Legislation Governing Highrisk Ai Use
Moreover Passing The Burden Of Adherence To Ai Regulation To General Practice Would Disadvantage A Sector
Already Under Considerable Time And Financial Pressures
The Racgp Would Support Crossindustry Development Of A Framework For The Use Of Ai In Medical Settings
Where Gps Have A Seat At The Table And Can Bring Their Vast Knowledge To Bear On This Topic We Would Welcome
The Opportunity To Collaborate On Such A Project
In Summary Our Key Recommendations Are
1 A Riskbased Approach For Responsible Ai Be Mandated Through Regulation

Gradient Institute Submission In Response To The Department Of Industry
Science And Resources Discussion Paper","Gradient Institute Believes That Design Of Ai Regulation Should Be Motivated By Careful
Examination Of The Risks Ai Creates However For Such An Approach To Be Eective It Must
1 Identify The Key Risks Arising From Use And Development Of Ai
2 Determine The Mechanisms Causing Those Risks To Arise
3 Provide Eective Risk Controls Targeting Those Mechanisms
In This Response We Define Two Distinct Categories Of Ai Risk Caused By Dierent Mechanisms
That Are Relevant To The Discussion Paper
• Ai Application Risk Risk Arising From The Use Of Ai In A Particular Application Present
Because Of An Interaction Between Properties Of The Application And Properties Of The
Ai System
• Ai Development Risk Risk Arising From Ai Development Present Before The Ai System
Is Applied To A Particular Domain
We Argue That Targeting These Dierent Mechanisms Requires Three Classes Of Regulation
• Sectorspecific Regulation Such As Professional Standards For Medical Practitioners Or
Requirements For Vehicle Safety Which Helps Control Ai Application Risk General Regulation Such As Privacy Or Antidiscrimination Law Which Also Helps
Control Ai Application Risk As Well As Other Nontechnologyspecific Risks Such As
Copyright Violation But Applies Similar Interventions Across Application Boundaries
• Technologyspecific Regulation Analogous To That Which Governs The Creation Of
Steam Boilers Or Recombinant Dna Products Which We Claim Will Be Required To Help
Control Ai Development Risk
Based On These Observations We Contend
1 The Riskbased Approach Of Preset Risktiering Outlined In The Discussion Paper
Especially For Instance Box 4 Wrongly Tries To Control Application Risks Across A Wide
Range Of Contexts With Technologyspecific Regulation This Approach Fails To Properly
Target Controls Towards The Contextspecific Risks Posed By An Application And Will Lead
To Ineective Management Of Those Risks What Is Needed Instead Is Support For Existing Sectorspecific And General Regulations To Be Clarified Modified Or Enhanced
As Needed To Respond To The Use Of Ai In Their Area Of Concern
2 The New Safety Risks Created By Certain Highly Capable Foundation Models Frontier
Models Are Not Acknowledged These Risks Arise From Ai Development And Are Not
Specific To An Application Sector New Technologyspecific Regulation Of The
Development Of Frontier Models Is Required In Order To Prevent These Risks From Arising

Itself

Likely Be Insufficient To Protect Against The Potential Harms Of Ai 1]

The Potential Harms Of Ai And That Observations Drawn From Operationallythoughtful And Responsiblyconstructed Experiments In Suitably

The Use Of Isoeic 229892022 Is A Great Start Particularly In Its Emphasis That Ai Is A Broad
Field Of Which Machine Learning Ml Is Only A Part The Use Of An Internationally Recognized
Definition Also Ensures Broad Compatibility Of Terms
However Care Should Be Taken To Actually Use This Definition Throughout The Discussion Paper
While The Iso Definition Encompasses Ml As Well As A Wide Range Of Other Nonml Based Ai
Techniques A Lot Of The Discussion Paper Uses Ai Synonymously With Ml Which Can Be
Confusing And Perpetuates Misconceptions That The Challenges And Issues Around Ml Exist In All
Of Ai
This Issue Flows Over To The Implied Definitions Of Other Terms For Example Generative Ai Is A
Broad Term That Encompasses The Use Of Ai To Generate Content Of Some Sort Via Both Neural
Networks And Other Means However Much Of The Discussion Paper And Other Documents Are
Written As If The Problems That Exist In Neural Network Based Generative Ai Exist For All Of Generative Ai Such Misconceptions Are Important To Dispel Because Generative Ai Itself Is A
Valuable Capability Regulations That Lump Generative Ai Technologies That Do Not Have The
Problems Of Neural Network Based Generative Ai With The Same Brush Can Only Serve To Reduce
Australian Competitiveness On The World Stage
The Definition For Bias Given In The Discussion Paper Is Also Somewhat Troubling Because The
Paper Ties It To The Notion That Increasing The Comprehensiveness Of A Dataset Reduces Its Bias
There Are Many Applications For Which There Is Simply Not Enough Data To Remove All Bias And
Others Where More Data In Highly Skewed Populations Can Increase Bias By Drowning Out
Poorly Represented Examples Data Is Also Historic It Illustrates Where We Have Been But It
Doesn’T Necessarily Reflect Where We Wish To Go This Is How Training Data Can Perpetuate
Historic Bias

Misconception That Ai Is Ml And Ml Makes Decisions Based On Data In Fact Many Forms Of Ai
And Ml Although Generally Not Neural Network Based Deep Learning At Least Without
Substantial Modifications Can Incorporate Background Information That Is Separate From The
Training Data For Example Background Information Could Be The Assertion That There Should Not
Be A Correlation Between Skin Colour And The Probability That A System Detects That A Person Is
Holding A Weapon This Information Can Be Used To Initialise Constrain And Otherwise Modify The

206,Submission To Supporting Responsible Ai Discussion Paper,"1 Do You Agree With The Definitions In This Discussion Paper If Not What Definitions Do You Prefer And Why

There Seems To Be Some Inconsistency In The Definitional Discussion On Pages 5 And 6 Upfront Ai Is A System That Generates Predictive Outputs Or Decisions For A Given Set Of Humandefined Objectives Or Parameters Without Explicit Programming But At 6 A Broad Definition Of Ai Is Intended That Includes Any Products Or Services Using Ai Techniques… T]Hese Techniques Range From Simple Rulesbased Algorithms Guided By Humandefined Parameters Ie To Machine Learning Neural Net Based Approaches This Seems To Broaden Beyond The Original In That The First Excludes Explicit Programming But The Second Appears To Readmit It At This Stage Of Consultation We Believe Broader Is Better Chasing Semantic Issues Can Lead To Confusion And Under Or Over Inclusion Or Unproductive Boundary Disputes At Too Early A Stage

There Is A Much More Fundamental Issue Here That The Affordances Introduced By Ai Surfaces Technology Per Se Is Not The Issue Technology Is A Tool Rather The More Important Issue Is The Underlying Set Of Policy Positions We Have Adopted In A Range Of Complex Interlocking Areas It Is Important Not To Allow The Debate On Technology And Definitions Obscure This And If Technology Itself Is Not The Issue Then It Is The Wrong Target For Regulatory Reform To Return Briefly To The First Paragraph Definitional Issues Would Be More Significant If Technology Alone Was The Issue 

Consider The Example Of The Failures Connected To The 737Max There May Be Arguments As To Whether That Software Fits Within A Given Definition Of Ai Or Adm But Does That Debate Really Matter In The Context Of Risk And Responsibility And Regulatory Responses Arguably Not Perhaps It Is Splitting Hairs 
Let Us Then Consider ‘Soft’ Automation In The Broad Robodebt Illustrates This It Was Not A Sophisticated ‘Ai’ Based Implementation But In The Public Imagination And Debate It Has Been Cast Within The Broader Schema Of Ai Roboadvice Etc Really It Was A Policy Decision Implemented Through A Simple Algorithm Deployed At Scale And Speed Through Softwarebased Implementation And Developed Protected And Sustained By A Policy Position Failure Of Oversight And Broader Culture That Was Fundamentally Human In Origin And With Dire Human Costs As Well As The Obvious Financial And Reputational Impacts",420,390,['do you agree with the definitions in this discussion paper if not what definitions do you prefer and why there seems to be some inc ##ons ##iste ##ncy in the definition ##al discussion on pages and up ##front ai is a system that generates predict ##ive outputs or decisions for a given set of human ##de ##fine ##d objectives or parameters without explicit programming but at a broad definition of ai is intended that includes any products or services using ai techniques these techniques range from simple rules ##base ##d algorithms guided by human ##de ##fine ##d parameters ie to machine learning neural net based approaches this seems to broad ##en beyond the original in that the first exclude ##s explicit programming but the second appears to read ##mit it at this stage of consultation we believe broader is better chasing semantic issues can lead to confusion and under or over inclusion or un ##pro ##ductive boundary disputes at too early a stage there is a much more fundamental issue here that the afford ##ances introduced by ai surfaces technology per se is not the issue technology is a tool rather the more important issue is the underlying set of policy positions we have adopted in a range of complex inter ##lock ##ing areas it is important not to allow the debate on technology and definitions obscure this and if technology itself is not the issue then it is the wrong target for regulatory reform to return briefly to the first paragraph definition ##al issues would be more significant if technology alone was the issue consider the example of the failures connected to the max there may be arguments as to whether that software fits within a given definition of ai or ad ##m but does that debate really matter in the context of risk and responsibility and regulatory responses arguably not perhaps it is splitting hairs let us then consider soft automation in the broad rob ##ode ##bt illustrates this it was not a sophisticated ai based implementation but in the public imagination and debate it has been cast within the broader sc ##hema of ai rob ##oa ##d ##vic ##e etc really it was a policy decision implemented through a simple algorithm deployed at scale and speed through software ##base ##d implementation and developed protected and sustained by a policy position failure of oversight and broader culture that was fundamentally human in origin and with dire human costs as well as the obvious financial and reputation ##al impacts']

Context In Which Ai Is Deployed As Well As The Underlying Risks In The Technology Itself There
Should Also Be Clear Routes For Redress Where Things Go Wrong Building On Existing Legislation
• Flexibility Agility And Periodic Regulatory And Legislative Reviews Should Be Built In From The

Requirements For Regulators To Engage Regularly With Industry Experts Drawing From A Wide Range
Of Backgrounds And Generational Perspectives • In Assuming A Greater Role In Regulating The Use Of Ai Regulators Should Be Strengthened In

• If The Government Wants To Ensure That Australian Languages Religious Outlooks Values And
Cultural References Are Protected While Also Minimising The Risk Of Adopting Biases Seen
Elsewhere In The World Steps Must Be Taken To Make Australian Datasets More Readily
Available For Use In Ai

136,"Response To The Consultation
Paper On Ai And Adm Regulation","There Exist Several Potential Risks From Artificial Intelligence Ai That We Believe Australia’S Existing Regulatory
Approaches Do Not Sufficiently Address As Noted In The Discussion Paper One Such Risk Is The Inherent Bias And
Discriminatory Outcomes That Can Occur In Ai Systems Particularly Those Utilising Machine Learning Algorithms These
Risks Can Arise Due To Biased Training Data Or Algorithms That Reinforce Systemic Discrimination To Mitigate These Risks
We Suggest The Implementation Of Legislation That Mandates The Use Of Bias Testing And Mitigation Measures During The
Development And Deployment Of Ai Systems Such A Regulation Would Help Ensure Fairness And Equality In Aidriven
Decisions And Services As A Laboratory Specialising In Biometrics And Ai Testing We Believe It Is Essential That Any
Proposed Measures Or Initiatives Reinforce The Need For Independent Testing And Assurance Of Systems That Include Ai
Or Adm And The Underlying Algorithms
Another Risk Pertains To Privacy And Data Security Especially With Advancements In Ai And Automated Decisionmaking Adm Technologies That Use Large Volumes Of Personal Data The Existing Privacy Act Does Not Fully Consider
These New Dynamics Introduced By Ai We Propose The Establishment Of A New Regulation To Specifically Address Data
Protection In Ai And Adm Technologies Including For Example Provisions For Anonymisation Of Data Used In Ai Training
And Decisionmaking Processes
The Australian Government Can Implement Several Nonregulatory Initiatives To Support Responsible Ai Practices One
Such Initiative Could Be The Promotion Of Educational And Training Programmes Aimed At Creating Awareness Of Ai
Ethics And Responsible Ai Practices The Government Could Also Fund Research Into Mitigating Ai Biases Ensuring
Privacy In Ai Systems And Designing More Transparent Ai Models To Support This We Believe That Testing And Related
Assurance Mechanisms Are A Key Part Of The Future Safe Use Of Ai There Is An Opportunity For Australia To Build
Capability In This Field To Support Responsible Development Of Ai And Its Uses Internationally

Another Factor In American Ai Guidelines Concerns The Composition Of Datasets Used To Train Ai Models The Fda Guidelines Seem To Be Clear On The Following Points
• Fad Do Not Allow For The Use Of Local Population Data To Reiterate And Fine Tune Ai Models Because This Will Introduce Output Bias The American Ai Model Essentially Becomes A Locked Algorithm There Is No Reinforcement Learning Also The Training Data Set Is Isolated From The Validation Set – This Would Mean Validation Techniques Such As Tenfold Cross Validation Would Not Allow For Fda Approval Of Ai Model Approval
• All Ai Models Used In Medicine Must Be Trained And Validated Using A Minimum Of 50 Usa Population Data
• All Ai Models Used In Diagnostic Medicine Must Be Tested And Certified Against Two Usa Board Certified Radiologists
There May Well Be Many More Pertinent Points Of Comparison Between The Fdaamerica Vs Tgaaustralia But The Above Three Points Deserve Consideration

The Essence Of The Problem Is That Ai Created Using Dl Methods Has No Potential To Ever

Occurred To The Developers To Flag Which Essentially Amounts To Slapping A Bandaid On The

Science And Resources For Submissions In Response To Its June 2023 Discussion Paper Safe
And Responsible Ai In Australia
2 In General We Commend To You The Ethics Centre’S Publication Principles For Good Technology
Which Is Attached To This Submission The Paper Offers Arguments In Support Of A Generic Ethics
Framework That Is Intended To Apply To All Forms Of Technology – Of Which Ai Is One Form
3 That Said A Number Of The Examples Considered In The Text Are Directly Concerned With The
Development And Application Of Ai It Is Worth Noting That The Centre’S Approach Seeks To
Encourage
§ Innovation Giving Rise To A Diverse Range Of Technologies
§ The Incorporation Of Core Values And Principles At The Earliest Point Of Design And
Development
§ The Use Of Technology Such As Blockchain To Track The Ethical Provenance Of All Ai Systems
Tools And Platforms Including The Identification Of Core Values And Principles Embedded In The
Technology Any Changes To The Original Design And Function Of The Technology Etc
§ Ongoing Assurance That The ‘Ethical Restraints’ Embedded In The Technology Have Been
Maintained Or Enhanced – With The Assurance Being Provided By Disinterested Expert Third
Parties
4 Beyond The General Principles Of The Proposed Framework There Is One Specific Suggestion That
We Would Especially Commend It Is That Australia Establish An Agency That Provides In The Case
Of Ai Robotics And Related Technologies The Same Degree Of Protection Afforded By The
Therapeutic Goods Authority Tga For Pharmaceuticals In A Similar Manner We Think It Important
That New Technologies Devices Systems Etc Only Be Released To The Public If They Are Proven To
Be Both Safe And Effective
5 A New Regulatory Authority Could Help To Build Public Trust In New Technologies And Prevent Some
Of The More Dystopian Fictions From Becoming Real Importantly With The Evolution Of Blockchain
Etc We Have The Technical Tools Available To Create A System Of Regulation That Can Also Make
Good Use Of The Assurance Skills To Be Found In The Private Sector As Such There Is An Opportunity
To ‘Shape’ The Environment From The Moment Of Initial Design To Ultimate Deployment In A Way That
Best Serves The Public Interest … Without Limiting The Scope For Innovation
6 This Last Point Is Important While It Is Prudent For Society To Establish Core Principles That Inform
The Development Of Ai And Related Technologies We Should Avoid Ever Specifying The Form In
Which Those Principles Should Be Given Practical Effect Rather Novel Approaches Should Be
Encouraged – With The Onus Being Placed On Developers To Demonstrate How In Each Case The
Core Ethical Requirements Have Been Realised

Japan Has Already Secured A Deal With Nvidia To Build A Very Large Ai Data Research Centre The Deal Appears To Give Japan An Exclusive Advantage They Did This By By Removing G Copyright And Privacy Of All Materials Consumed By Ai They Are The First In The World To Do This This Will Mean Ai Model Can Be Build Off Any Information With Having To Get Permission To Use The Information This Will Mean Models Built In Japan Can Be Build Faster By Removing Red Tape Massively
They Also Offered Nvidia This Also Offered Nvidia Large Amounts Of Money To Get The Detail Over The Line I Suspect China Taiwan And South Korea Will Attempt To Do The Same To Compete With Us Current Dominance In Ai Not To Be Out Done By Japan
