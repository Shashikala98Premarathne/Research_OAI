commonwealth state territory to ensure there is a consistent approach to ai including related obligations and requirements stream ##lining and sim ##plify ##ing regulation to promote its effectiveness should be a priority for the government rather than introducing additional regulations to an already complex and burden ##some system for the private sector the australian government should continue

technologies to the delivery of medicine our position statement on electronic clinical decision support also includes recommendations relevant to ai in short our view is that ai has the potential to revolution ##ise the delivery of medicine and regulation must keep pace with these technologies to keep patients safe further gps must be included and involved in the development and implementation of relevant ai technologies as well as the regulatory approaches that govern their use in australia as gps see more than two million patients each week with almost nine in ten people consulting a gp every year gp involvement is crucial in ensuring ai technologies in healthcare are safe to use and fit ##for ##pur ##pose the ut ##ilis ##ation of expertise of gps in the design testing implementation regulation and post ##market surveillance of relevant ai products will give the best hope these technologies are appropriate for use with patients by clinic ##ians in the australian primary care setting for this reason while the ra ##c ##gp supports the risk ##base ##d approach to governance outlined in the discussion paper we suggest that gps must be involved in assessing and quan ##tify ##ing relevant risks as touched upon in the discussion paper using un ##re ##pres ##ent ##ative data ##set ##s to train ai systems can introduce bias into ai decision ##making a problem that can have del ##eter ##ious consequences in medicine including mis ##dia ##gno ##sis and under ##dia ##gno ##sis and can ex ##ace ##rba ##te health inequality however as noted the solution to this issue is the use of large high ##qual ##ity data ##set ##s for ai training and these can only be built with the knowledge and consent of patients who have a right to privacy and security of their health data which might be both personal and sensitive gps have insights into these problems that would be useful to policy ##makers and ##or regulators gp involvement in risk identification might help prevent the appearance of new and un ##for ##ese ##en problems of safety and quality that arise after implementation gp involvement is also likely to be key in building trust in and up ##take of ai systems within the primary care setting the ra ##c ##gp is supportive of a risk ##base ##d approach for responsible ai to be mandated through regulation which should be applied to ai developers while there is potential for ai to present technological advancement ##s that save and enhance patients lives the risks to patient safety inherent to many medical ai applications and potential for related liability to the clinic ##ian are significant simply en ##trust ##ing industry to adhere to a voluntary code of ethics is not enough where there are potential gaps in existing legislation governing high ##ris ##k ai use moreover passing the burden of adherence to ai regulation to general practice would disadvantage a sector already under considerable time and financial pressures the ra ##c ##gp would

welcome the opportunity to collaborate on such a project in summary our key recommendations are a risk ##base ##d approach for responsible ai be mandated through regulation an oversight body be

social impact and ensure it continues to benefit and not harm patients health care professionals and the wider community therefore while we welcome this consultation the ama would like to see a separate discussion process focusing specifically on ai in healthcare that would bring together all relevant stakeholders i am a senior lecturer and researcher in technology law and intellectual

traditional search strategies for adapting to this changing landscape with recommendations of specific critical success factors for groups of stakeholders from medical affairs to information technology considerations for an ethical framework to guide our response i believe there are notable differences in the ai landscape between usa and australia regarding monopoly of healthcare data for the public good in america clinic ##ians had considerable sway over the decision to release patient data for research purposes including ai development in diagnostic procedures during this time there were multiple hold ##ups in advancing ai due to lack of appropriate data sources the federal government then passed laws making it illegal to mono ##polis ##e data by an overseeing clinic ##ian and additionally implemented a system of he ##ft ##y fines for exhibiting mono ##polis ##ing behaviour since these laws have been passed i understand there have been no reported instances of auto ##cratic ownership of patient data by american physicians this type of regulation needs to be extended to australia to protect the patient and democrat ##ise the ownership of ai data another factor in american ai guidelines concerns the composition of data ##set ##s used to train ai models the fda guidelines seem to be clear on the following points fa ##d do not allow for the use of local population data to rei ##tera ##te and fine tune ai models because this will introduce output bias the american ai model essentially becomes a locked algorithm there is no reinforcement learning also the training data set is isolated from the validation set this would mean validation techniques such as ten ##fold cross validation would not allow for fda approval of ai model approval all ai models used in medicine must be trained and valid ##ated using a minimum of usa population data all ai models used in diagnostic medicine must be tested and certified against two usa board certified radio ##logists there may well be many more per ##tine ##nt points of comparison between the fda ##ame ##rica vs t ##ga ##aus ##tral ##ia but the above three points deserve consideration if australia is going to advance in medical ai adoption greater transparency should be adopted by t ##ga when looking at medical ai technology registered with t ##ga one has a name date patent number and not much else when looking through the fda equivalent there is a much fuller description of the ai model to the point of being able to read the code used in the model this is another disc ##re ##pan ##cy worth a closer look the australian government has a responsibility to oversee the democrat ##isation of population data for the development of australian ai medical industry and research it would be a very positive step to have an agreed it tool which would be unanimously used to dei ##dent ##ify patient data particularly di ##com images currently there is a very hot ##ch ##pot ##ch approach towards cleaning data for an ##ony ##mity the lack of available medical data sets will negatively impact ai research in australia and limits ai research performed by healthcare professionals urgent need for education across the board accessible free courses that enable the general population to understand risks and benefits and make informed judgement ##s about what is true un ##tr ##ue ai generated i am a phd candidate working on hospital ultrasound digital images hospitals and private imaging practices seem semi ##para ##ly ##sed in releasing any an ##ony ##mise ##d patient images for research purposes they don ##t know how to do it or where to put it its creating a monopoly for commercial industry to access imaging research data and st ##if ##ling research from academic avenues using patient images for research purposes should be made a uniform and transparent process across australia with generic tools and platforms used to dei ##dent ##ify store and transfer images there appears to be too much fear in sharing digital images for medical diagnostic research organisations are so caught up in avoiding ransom attacks and mal ##ware ni ##st they seem unable to avoid with ##holding digital data to benefit the public good research papers from europe and america frequently have data sets of tens of thousands of patient image files i would like to see democratic access to an ##ony ##mise ##d images in australia on behalf of the aus ##tral ##asian college of der ##mat ##ologists ac ##d i would like to thank you for the opportunity to comment on the department of industry science and resources discussion paper the paper safe and responsible artificial intelligence al in australia ac ##d is the sole medical college accredited by the australian medical council amc for the training and continuing professional development of medical practitioners in the specialty of der ##mat ##ology we are the national peak membership organisation representing over der ##mat ##ologist fellows fa ##cd and trainee ##s as the leading authority in australia for der ##mat ##ology we provide information advocacy and advice to individuals communities government and other health stakeholders on der ##mat ##ological practice diagnosis and management of der ##mat ##ological conditions has significantly evolved with rapid advancement ##s in technology and innovation creating new opportunities and risks for patient care as der ##mat ##ology is a highly visual specialty there is increasing interest both in australia and internationally in the opportunities for al particularly image ##base ##d al to improve patient access to der ##mat ##ological care and to enhance quality of care ac ##ds digital health committee have been closely monitoring and advising on these developments including the opportunities risks and regulatory considerations to inform education and guidance for our fellows der ##mat ##ologists trainee ##s government and other stakeholders we therefore support the intent of this paper to identify potential gaps in the governance of ai in australia and opportunities to strengthen governance mechanisms to support the safe ethical and effective development adoption and use of ai this submission provides a brief overview of the context for our work in this area and the research and recommendations that we have made to date in relation to the development regulation and adoption of ai technology in der ##mat ##ology in australia the full minute presentation is available at i write on behalf of the bio ##metric ##s institute an independent and international not ##for ##pro ##fi ##t membership organisation with a long history of promoting the responsible ethical and effective use of bio ##metric ##s the bio ##metric ##s institute was established in in australia supported in part by the federal government with a mission to promote the responsible ethical and effective use of bio ##metric technologies since then our membership has expanded to include government agencies banks tel ##cos social media platforms technology and services providers academics and regulators from over countries around a quarter of which are in our foundation ##al home of australia in support of our mission we connect stakeholders internationally through a range of events produce a range of good practice material to support those governing and implementing bio ##metric ##s and lead thought about bio ##metric ##s today and into the future over the past few years surveys of stakeholders by the institute have increasingly identified that insufficient regulation imp ##edes advancement of bio ##metric technology globally this perspective is likely informed by an understanding that there are material risks associated with the use of bio ##metric ##s particularly when handled without due respect for privacy and ethical considerations some of these risks are shared with other applications in the field of artificial intelligence therefore we are pleased to see consultation on how artificial intelligence might be regulated as a membership organisation accountable to a wide range of members including the governments of many different nations the institute cannot comment directly on proposals that may arise in any particular jurisdiction but we certainly encourage australian authorities and the private sector to connect with the bio ##metric ##s institute which does provide training thought leadership and forums this opportunity has been utilized by many key government agencies and the private sector including not ##for ##pro ##fi ##ts and consumer groups some physicians in their care of patients at risk of mis ##using op ##io ##ids use machine learning mlb ##ase ##d prediction drug monitoring programmes pd ##mps to guide their decision making in the prescription of op ##io ##ids this can cause a conflict a pd ##mp score can indicate a patient is at a high risk of op ##io ##id abuse while a patient express ##ly reports opposite ##ly the pre ##scribe ##r is then left to balance the credibility and trust of the patient with the pd ##mp score po ##zzi argues that a pre ##scribe ##r who down ##grade ##s the credibility of a patients testimony based on a low pd ##mp score is ep ##iste ##mic ##ally and morally un ##just ##ified and contributes to a form of test ##imo ##nia ##l injustice this results in patients being silenced excluded from decision ##making processes and subjected to structural injustice ##s additionally the use of ml systems in medical practices raises concerns about per ##pet ##uating existing in ##e ##qual ##ities over ##est ##imating their capabilities and di ##sp ##la ##cing human authority however almost the very same critique ##s apply to human ##base ##d systems formal ##isation ml systems included should instead be viewed positively and precisely as a powerful means to begin er ##od ##ing these and other problems in ethical ##ly sensitive domains in this case the ep ##iste ##mic virtues of formal ##isation include promoting transparency consistency and replica ##bility in decision making rigorous ml systems can also help ensure that models ab ##ide by express standards constraints constraints which are well defined and which are open to scrutiny and improvements both within and outside the specific domain of application this is therefore an opportunity for less injustice not more\n"
